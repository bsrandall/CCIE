We saw previously that when decalring an area as a stub, the ABRs for that area will cease flooding Type 4 and Type 5 LSAs into that area. Instead, a Type 3 Summary LSA is injected for the 0.0.0.0 network. External routes are led to follow a default route, but all other inter-area routes are still flooded into the Area by the ABR.

On the ABR to the stub area, you can optionally advise the ABR to not advertise Type 3 Summaries into the Stub Area, further reducing the topology information that is required in a stub area.
```
R1(config)# router ospf 1
R1(config-router)# area 3 stub no-summary
```
The no-summary feature only needs to be applied to the ABR - the rest of the routers in the area would just need to declare **area 3 stub**.

After this configuration the ABR will not send any Type 3 Sumary LSAs into the area, so all traffic out will have to follow default route(s).
