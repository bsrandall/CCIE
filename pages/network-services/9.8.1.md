Proxy ARP is the technique in which one host, typically a router, answers ARP requests intended for another machine. The router then takes responsibility for forwarding packets to the host it answered for when packets arrive at its interface destined for the IP address that was Proxy ARPd. Proxy ARP can help machines on a remote subnet that do not have routing configured reach other subnets on the network. Proxy ARP is needed on any segment where the hosts do not have a default agteway configured.

There are some disadvantages of Proxy ARP.
- It increases the amount of ARP traffic on the segment.
- Hosts need larger ARP tables
- Security can be undermined

Proxy ARP is enabled by default. If you wish to disable it, use the no version of the command.
```;
R1(config)# interface GigabitEthernet0/1
R1(config-if)# no ip proxy-arp
R1(config-if)# end
```
If proxy ARP is disabled, the router will only respond to ARP requests for the interface's IP address.
