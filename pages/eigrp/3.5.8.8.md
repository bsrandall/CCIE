Here we will look at the configuration methods of prefix filtering in EIGRPv6. The differences between IPv4 and IPv6 prefix filtering are not many. Of course, you are dealing with IPv6 hex addresses instead of the dotted decimal IPv4 addresses. If you are configuring the distribute-list in named configuration, mode, it is in Address Family Topology configuration mode. If you are configuring it under IPv6 classic mode, it is directly in the router configuration mode.
```
R1(config)# ipv6 prefix-list FILTER1 sec 10 deny 2002:0:0:1::/64
R1(config)# ipv6 prefix-list FILTER1 sec 20 permit ::/0 le 128
R1(config)# router EIGRP TEST
R1(config-router)# address-family ipv6 unicast autonomous-system 100
R1(config-router-af)# topology base
R1(config-router-af-topology)# distribute-list prefix-list FILTER1 in GigabitEthernet0/1
R1(config-router-af-topology)# exit
```
Notice two things from above. First the IPv6 equivalent to 0.0.0.0/0 le 32 when wanting to allow or deny all addresses is ::/0 le128. Second, the only option for a distribute-list in IPv6 is a **prefix-list** - no access lists are allowed as a filter. In IPv4 you could use standard, extended, and named access lists with distribute lists. In addition, *the use of Route Maps is not supported* with distribute lists in EIGRP for IPv6.

In my VIRL lab, there is no support for Offset Lists. However, the Cisco documentation doesnâ€™t seem to indicate that IPv6 lacks this feature for EIGRP.
