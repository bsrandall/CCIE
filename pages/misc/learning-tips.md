These are notes from Stephanie Burns, PhD in Adult Learning. She did a learning webinar for CCIE.

### How We Learn Long-Term
There are 4 ways we learn items for the long term.
- Make a static picture of the information
- Make a motion picture of the information
- Envision yourself doing the task / seeing the information
- Make a map of the information and then be able to Zoom In and Zoom Out of the details

Because of the Maps, it will be better to break down page articles into well organized sections.

### How to Read the Right Way
Reading is an assertive act. Reading in a passive manner accomplishes nothing more than getting you familiar with an overview of the topic. It may make you comfortable with the overall comprehension of the subject, but you will not learn any details. Therefore, when we read, we need to do the following:
- read the needed material as fast and as efficient as possible
- get in and output
- go into the task of reading with a purpose

We should plan on reading for a purpose. Extract the details as quickly as possible and then get to learning the details.

The brain will accomplish the task you ask it to do while reading. Do you want to:
- Read for comprehension
- Read to prepare for a testing
- Read to refresh knowledge
- Read to find a specific fact

Before you start a reading session, make sure you have a goal in mind.

### Photographic Memory
Nobody really has photographic memory when it comes to text. It would be completely meaningless. What people with photographic memory are capable of doing is making great mental maps of the information. Everybody has this capability, it is just some have mastered it.

As I have been thinking about how I learn, I learn my best when I can walk through the topic with a clear mental image. The other thing that is interesting is that I don't really even need quiet time to master such a mental image. The interruptions actually help me test my recollection. Review the map in my head, fill in any gaps I do not know, get interrupted, then review again to see if I can still recall.

One interesting topic that Dr. Burns brings up is getting a basic topology map in your head and then using that map to frame information around that map. So have one mental map that multiple topologies could then be overlayed onto. Genius!

### My Takeaways
Always have a purpose. Do not go through the motion. Learning is an active process.

As adults, we forget that we have to study to learn. For some reason we start thinking we can just read something and remember it forever. That is simply not the case.

Use your finger or hand to follow along text as you are reading. Nobody can read quickly without this tip. That means I always need to read from a book or IPad.

Use images when learning terms. The more you can transfer text to images, the more memorable the terms will be.

Learning occurs only when in the right context. So learning words by starting at the beginning of the dictionary is unnatural, but learning definitions of words that you encounter while reading occurs in context.

Reading after you are familiar with a topic is very productive, probably more productive than reading when you do not have any familiarity with the subject. This is all because in the former, you are reading with context!

Flashcards are a poor learning mechanism for this very reason - there is no context. They are good for practicing/testing but not for learning.

Video lectures are similar to reading. They make way more sense if you have some context about the subject. I would use them as a way to confirm or help learn subject matter. You must actively watch them, learning the familiar topics and then making notes of the unfamiliar topics so that you can review and learn later. If there are items you know already during the lecture, use that time to actively review your mental images instead of just letting your mind wander aimlessly.

Take FREQUENT and CONSISTENT action. It is way better to do three 1 hour learning sessions compared to doing one 3 hour session. At the beginning of each session have a goal in mind - this leaves you with a feeling of accomplishment at the end of each session. The alternative is studying until you are tired or frustrated, which leaves you with a negative memory of studying.

75% of all CCIE Candidates quit.

This is for all things in life. Just START and then DECIDE. If you have 50 small chores to do around the house, just start doing one of them and the rest will follow. Starting is the hardest part!

We do well with external pressure. Most school aged children graduate high school because they have the external pressure from their parents. The more external pressure you can add, the more successful you will probably be.

Finally, a learning Map can be a great tool. The mind needs some way to organize the information. I should definitely start working on such a creature. The INE Blueprint is great, transforming that into a graphic should be a priority.
