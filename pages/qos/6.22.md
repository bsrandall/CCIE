This is a legacy Frame-Relay method and is probably unlikely to appear on the exam. I will cover it briefly.

The Frame Relay Voice-Adaptive Traffic Shaping and Fragmentation feature helps ensure voice quality by adjusting the rate of traffic and activating fragmentation on the basis of the presence of voice on the permanent virtual circuit (PVC). Frame Relay voice-adaptive traffic shaping enables a PVC to adjust the rate of traffic if packets are detected in the priority queue or if H.323 call setup signaling packets are detected. Frame Relay voice-adaptive fragmentation allows fragmentation to be activated when priority-queue or H.323 signaling packets are detected. When priority-queue traffic and signaling packets are not present, Frame Relay voice-adaptive fragmentation allows fragmentation to be deactivated.

With the Voice-Adaptive Traffic Shaping, the router reduces the PVC sending rate to minCIR whenever voice packets are detected in the LLQ. When there are no packets present in the LLQ, the router increases the sending rate of the PVC from minCIR to CIR to maximize throughput. Voice-Adaptive Traffic Shaping is done within a policy map.

R1(config-pmap-c)# end
