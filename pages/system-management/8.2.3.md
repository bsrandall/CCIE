You can set timetamps up differently for both debugging and logging messages. They can be based on either the router's uptime or the current date and time.
```
R1(config)# service timestamps debug uptime
R1(config)# service timestamps log datetime msec year
```

Configuring sequence numbers is a good way to ensure that system messages are not tampered with once they arrive at the syslog server. Sequencing can be used in combination with timestamps.
```
R1(config)# service sequence-numbers
```
