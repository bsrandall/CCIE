IP Access Violation Accounting records traffic that *fails* an IP access control list. IP Access Violation Accounting does not account for any traffic that passes through an ACL. It is supported on both ingress and egress traffic. Even though it supports both ingress and egress traffic, the traffic filtered by means of the access-list **in** or **out** command is not differentiated. Configuration is straightforward.
```
R1(config-if)# ip accounting access-viloations
```
If you want to set the threshold count, or the maximum number of accounting entries to be accumulated, use this command:
```
R1(config)# ip accounting-threshold \<count\>
```
The default number of entries (source and destination pairs) is 512.

The show command is **show ip accounting access-violations**. A working configuration might look something like this:
```
router(config)#access-list 107 deny ip host 192.1.1.110 host 192.1.1.97
router(config)#access-list 107 permit ip any any
router(config)#int serial 0/0
router(config-if)#ip accounting output-packets
router(config-if)#ip accounting access-violations
router(config-if)#ip access-group 107 out
router(config-if)#exit
```
