Filtering based on maximum-prefix number is an important BGP security feature. The number of BGP prefixes on the Internet is many hundreds of thousands. It is possible to overwhelm a BGP speaker’s table by injecting too many prefixes and putting too much stress on router’s CPU or memory. Cisco IOS supports special feature called **neighbor maximum-prefix** that limits the maximum number of prefixes received over a BGP session. You specify a number of prefixes that is the maximum number of allowed prefixes to learn from the neighbor. You can use a Threshold % at which point to issue a warning syslog message. If you only want a warning and do not want the session to be shut down when the **maximum-prefix** value is exceeded, issue the **warning-only** keyword. Another optional parameter is **restart \<minutes\>** which will automatically restart the shut down session after the specified number of minutes.
```
`R1(config)# router bgp 200
R1(config-router)# neighbor 155.1.146.6 maximum-prefix 20 80 restart 3
R1(config-router)# exit
```
`The above would set a maximum-prefix limit of 20 routes, issues a warning at 16 routes, and if 20 routes are exceeded shut down the session and restart it after 3 minutes.
