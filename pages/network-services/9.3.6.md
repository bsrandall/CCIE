DHCP Proxy is an address allocation solution for PPP. When a client requests an IP address via IPCP, the server may issue a DHCP request (act as a proxy) using its own IP address on the PPP interface as the "giaddr" field. You will also see this on wireless controllers. The configuration involves statements on the client configuration as well as the proxy.
```
Client(config)# interface Serial0/1
Client(config-if)# encapsulation ppp
Client(config-if)# ip address negotiated
Client(config-if)# no peer neighbor-route
Client(config-if)# end
```
And now for the proxy configuration:
```
R1(config)# interface Serial1/1
R1(config-if)# encapsulation ppp
R1(config-if)# ip address 155.1.23.3 255.255.255.0
R1(config-if)# peer default ip address dhcp
R1(config-if)# no peer neighbor-route
R1(config-if)# end
```
The **peer default ip address** command has several options. **address** specifies a single address to be used when a client connects. **pool** allocates an address out of a pool. Finally, the one we used here, **dhcp**, configures it such that the interface acts on the DHCP server's part to allocate a dynamic address.
