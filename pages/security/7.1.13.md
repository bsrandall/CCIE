IP Source Guard provides security on a Layer 2 port by filtering traffic from source IP addresses that are attempting to impersonate a legitimate host's IP address. The feature uses the DHCP snooping binding database, as well as static IP to MAC bindings, to match hosts on untrusted Layer 2 access ports.

When IP Source Guard is enabled, initially all traffic is blocked except DHCP messages. After the DHCP server has authorized the device and issued an IP address, or after an administrator has stacially mapped an IP address to its MAC address, traffic from the source IP is allowed on the network. IP Source Guard is a port based feature that automatically creates a PACL based on the data in the DHCP snooping binding database (or manual entries).

Here are a few keys regarding IP Source Guard:

- supported only on *ingress* Layer 2 ports
- not supported on private VLANs
- only supported in hardware
- does not support filtering of traffic based on MAC address
- supported on Layer 2 EtherChannel logical interface

Here is a sample configuration.
```
SW1(config)# ip dhcp snooping
SW1(config)# ip dhcp snooping vlan 2-99
SW1(config)# interface GigabitEthernet0/1
SW1(config-if)# switchport mode access
SW1(config-if)# switchport access vlan 2
SW1(config-if)# no ip dhcp snooping trust
SW1(config-if)# ip verify source vlan dhcp-snooping
SW1(config-if)# exit
SW1(config)# ip source binding 0fc0.0dc9.36a4 vlan 2 192.168.17.1
SW1(config)# exit
```

You can see the resulting PACL created for an interface by using this command:
```
SW1# show ip verify source interface GigabitEthernet0/1
