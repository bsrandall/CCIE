In multicast VLAN networks, subscribers to a multicast group can exist in more than one VLAN. If the VLAN boundary restrictions in a network consist of Layer 2 switches, it might be necessary to replicate the multicast stream to the same group in different subnets, even if they are on the same physical network. Multicast VLAN Registration (MVR) routes packets received in a multicast source VLAN to one or more receive VLANs. Clients are in the receive VLANs and the multicast server is in the source VLAN. Multicast routing has to be disabled when MVR is enabled.
```
SW1(config)# no ip multicast-routing distributed
SW1(config)# mvr
SW1(config)# mvr group 239.9.0.1
SW1(config)# mvr vlan 200
SW1(config)# interface GigabitEthernet0/1
SW1(config-if)# mvr type source
SW1(config-if)# exit
SW1(config)# interface GigabitEthernet0/2
SW1(config-if)# mvr type receiver
SW1(config-if)# exit
```
In this example, the receiver would be off interface GigabitEthernet0/2.
