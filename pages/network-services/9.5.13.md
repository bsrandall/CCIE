The NAT default interface feature allows all traffic received on the outside interface that does not already match an existing dynamic translation to be statically forwarded to an inside host.
```
R1(config)# ip nat inside source list 10 interface GigabitEthernet0/1 overload
R1(config)# ip nat inside source static 192.168.17.50 interface GigabitEthernet0/1
```
One use for this is for applications that use different outbound and inbound traffic flows.
