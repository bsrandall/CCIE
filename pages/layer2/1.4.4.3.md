Using Port Priority to determine path selection is no different than with PVST+. The only difference is that you are now applying the port priority of an interface per *instance* rather than per VLAN.
```
SW1(config)# int GigabitEthernet0/1
SW1(config-if) spanning-tree mst 1 port-priority 0
SW1(config-if) end
```
The default port priority is 128. The range is 0 - 240 and is in increments of 16. Of course, the lower the number the higher the priority.
