Prefix lists are used with the **distribute-list prefix** command to filter inbound or outbound routes. You permit or deny based on what you want to have happen to the route, so deny out would prevent updates being sent out regarding that prefix.
```
R1(config)# router rip
R1(config-router)# distribute-list NO-R3 in FastEthernet0/0
R1(config-router)# exit

R1(config)# ip prefix-list NO-R3 deny 192.168.3.0/24
R1(config)# ip prefix-list NO-R3 permit 0.0.0.0/0 le 32
```

Prefix lists are usually preferred for route filtering, while access-lists are usually better for data plane traffic. This is because prefix-lists match on both mask and network, while access lists cannot match on mask.

You can see below that distribute lists can be used with more than just prefix lists.
```
Router(config-router)#distribute-list ?
  <1-199>      IP access list number
  <1300-2699>  IP expanded access list number
  WORD         Access-list name
  gateway      Filtering incoming updates based on gateway
  prefix       Filter prefixes in routing updates
```

The rule when using multiple distribute lists is that you should be able to use one interface-specific distribute list per interface per-direction and one protocol-specific distribute list for each process/autonomous-system pair. WHen I was testing on VIRL it seemed to be one distribute-list per physical interface, as I could not use distribute lists on multiple subinterfaces.

We will go over access lists and extended access lists next.
