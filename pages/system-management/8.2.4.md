Here would be an example to create a syslog file in flash memory:
```
R1#mkdir flash0:/syslog
Create directory filename [syslog]?
Created dir flash0:/syslog
R1#
```

To then log to the newly created file, you need to let the logging process know of its existence.
```
R1(config)# logging persistent filesize 32768
R1(config)# logging persistent url flash0:syslog/
R1(config)# logging on
```
