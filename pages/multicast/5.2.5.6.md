PIM by default treats NBMA interfaces as if they were broadcast capable. Taken further, it assumes all neighbors on a WAN cloud can hear multicast packets sent by any neighbor. However in Hub and SPoke designs this is not the case - when a spoke send multicast traffic over the NBMA segment, only the hub can hear it. Because of split-horizon, the hub will not forward the multicast stream back out its interface to the other spokes. This problem could be solved using PIM NBMA mode, but this is only available with PIM Sparse Mode.

Since Auto-RP uses dense mode for RP information dissemination, the PIM NBMA option will not help with Auto-RP designs. The workaround is proper design - the Mapping Agent should always be palced at the hubon NBMA designs. RPs can still be palced at the spokes without a problem, as long as the MA is at the hub.

If placing the MA correctly is not possible, another solution is creating tunnels between the hubs and the spokes.
