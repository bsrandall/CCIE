##### Extended Access List General
While standard access lists are good for blocking traffic close to its destination, extended access lists are good for filtering anywhere. Unlike standard access lists which only match on source address, extended access lists match on source *and* destination address, as well as protocol type, port numbers, IP precedence, IP Options, and more.

Like standard access lists, extended access lists can be either named or numbered. They must be applied to an interface before they have any affect on traffic.

To begin extended access list configuration, define the list by giving it a name or a number.
```
R1(config)# ip access-list extended TEST
R1(config-ext-nacl)# 10 permit ?
  <0-255>       An IP protocol number
  ahp           Authentication Header Protocol
  eigrp         Cisco's EIGRP routing protocol
  esp           Encapsulation Security Payload
  gre           Cisco's GRE tunneling
  icmp          Internet Control Message Protocol
  igmp          Internet Gateway Message Protocol
  ip            Any Internet Protocol
  ipinip        IP in IP tunneling
  nos           KA9Q NOS compatible IP over IP tunneling
  object-group  Service object group
  ospf          OSPF routing protocol
  pcp           Payload Compression Protocol
  pim           Protocol Independent Multicast
  sctp          Stream Control Transmission Protocol
  tcp           Transmission Control Protocol
  udp           User Datagram Protocol
```
You can see here the protocols that can be matched. If you then were to choose tcp or udp, you could optionally match port numbers:
```
R1(config-ext-nacl)#10 permit tcp host 192.168.1.1 any
  A.B.C.D       Destination address
  any           Any destination host
  eq            Match only packets on a given port number
  gt            Match only packets with a greater port number
  host          A single destination host
  lt            Match only packets with a lower port number
  neq           Match only packets not on a given port number
  object-group  Destination network object group
  range         Match only packets in the range of port numbers
```
One great way during the lab to find port numbers if needed is to use the following:
```
R1#show ip port-map
Default mapping:  snmp                 udp port 161                        system defined
Default mapping:  echo                 tcp port 7                          system defined
Default mapping:  echo                 udp port 7                          system defined
Default mapping:  telnet               tcp port 23                         system defined
Default mapping:  wins                 tcp port 1512                       system defined
Default mapping:  n2h2server           tcp port 9285                       system defined
Default mapping:  n2h2server           udp port 9285                       system defined
Default mapping:  nntp                 tcp port 119                        system defined
Default mapping:  pptp                 tcp port 1723                       system defined
Default mapping:  rtsp                 tcp port 554,8554                   system defined

```

If using TCP, you also have the option of using the **established** keyword, which will only match established TCP connections, not new ones.
```
R1(config-ext-nacl)#10 permit tcp host 192.168.1.1 any established
```

Because of the stateless nature of access lists, when configuring extended access lists to filter traffic you will typically see a corresponding "outbound" rule for every "inbound" entry.

One thing to remember is that an outbound access list will not match a router's locally generated traffic - the outbound ACL only matches transit traffic.
##### FTP
To be able to correctly use extended access lists, it is often necesarry to know how the application you are trying to allow or filter operates. One classic example is FTP, which uses a separate data port and control port. The control port always uses destination port 21. The data connection then works in one of two modes, either active or passive.

In active mode, the server instructs the client to listen on an ephemeral port (above 1024) and initiates a connection to the client sourced from port 20.

In passive mode, the server opens a new ephemeral port and reports it to the client. The client then connects to the server on the ephemeral port and the data transfer begins. Notice port 20 is not used in passive mode.
##### Traceroute
Another application to understand is the traceroute utility. In the Cisco / Unix version the client send UDP probes with increasing TTL values starting at TTL of 1. The client sends probes to incrementing UDP ports starting at 33434. The destination IP for all packets is the target IP address. If the TTL expires, the receiving device responds with an ICMP time exceeded message from its own source address. The source node knows the hop number based on the incremented UDP port number. If the target IP receives the final packet, it responds with an ICMP unreachable message for the selected destination port. By default, the traceroute utility only probes up to 30 hops, so the default UDP port range is 33434 - 33464.
#####PMTUD
Finally PMTUD relies on the ICMP "packet too big" response, also known as "fragmentation required but DF bit set."

You can permit all ICMP unreachable messages by using the **unreachable** keyword, or you can permit the ICMP response messages needed selectively.
##### TTL
Here is an example of filtering on TTL:
```
R1(config)# ip access-list extended TTL_FILTER
R1(config-ext-nacl)# permit ip host 172.16.1.1 any ttl lt 2
```
