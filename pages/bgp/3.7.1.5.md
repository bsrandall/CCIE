eBGP multihop is used to connect peers that are more than 1 router hop away from each other. **neighbor disable-connected-check** is used to peer with a directly connected neighbor that is not on the same subnet - if they are not directly connected **disable-connected-check** will prevent the neighborship from forming, while eBGP multihop has no such restriction. One use case for this is if you are peering between loopbacks and not the connected interface between the peers. The command will not change the TTL, so the routers must still only be 1 hop away from each other.
```
R1(config)# router bgp 100
R1(config-router)# neighbor 198.14.27.2 remote-as 200
R1(config-router)# neighbor 198.14.27.2 disable-connected-check
R1(config-router)# exit
```
