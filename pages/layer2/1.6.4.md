The CAM Aging time is configured by the **mac-address-table aging-time** command. It is issued in global configuration mode. The default time is 300 seconds.

It is because of this long aging time that STP uses the Forward\_Time (15 seconds by default) to age out the CAM table when a TCN is detected.

With Catalyst Switches, if the *vlan* keyword is not used, the aging time specified will be used for all VLANs on the switch.

The *routed-mac* optional keyword specifies the routed MAC address aging time.
```
SW1(config)# mac-address-table aging-time 200 vlan 2
SW1(config)# exit
```
