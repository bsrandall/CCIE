Ignoring AS\_PATH length comparison is optional and could be enabled using a special hidden command. Using this feature in production is NOT recommended because it may severely affect routing table stability. However, if you need it just for some non-standard tweak of your BGP path selection, use the command **bgp bestpath as-path ignore** to activate this feature. BGP will automatically skip AS\_PATH length comparison and proceed to comparing the Origin codes, MED attribute, and the IGP costs for NEXT\_HOPs. 

One case in which you may actually need this feature is BGP confederations. Remember that BGP\_CONFED\_SEQUENCE and BGP\_CONFED\_SET do not count when computing the AS\_PATH length. Therefore, in BGP confederations you may see suboptimal paths being elected simply based on the AS\_PATH attribute carried from the external ASs (internal path lengths are ignored). By disabling the AS\_PATH comparison, you may force the local speakers to use the “hot potato” routing model, taking into account the IGP cost to reach the prefix NEXT\_HOP, that is only provided if all prefixes have the same Origin Code and MED attribute values, which could be enforced by border BGP routers.
