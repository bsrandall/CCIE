EIGRP Over the Top was an EIGRP enhancement in version 15.0. The main idea is that EIGRP Over the Top allows you to run EIGRP over any IP infrastructure. It was created to solve the problem of trying to run EIGRP over a provider MPLS IPVPN network. Before the Over the Top enhancement, there was no way to encapsulate EIGRP packets over any IP network, short of perhaps building out a GRE mesh. EIGRP Over the Top uses LISP as the tunneling mechanism for neighbors to reach each other over the IP infrastructure.

You can optionally use an EIGRP Route Reflector. In this setup, all of the neighbor peering happen back to the Route Reflector, instead of having to create a neighbor mesh. The configuration is simple, and you just need to use the **remote-neighbors** command to enable the router to act as a route-reflector dynamically. Then on the neighbors just remember to establish neighbor adjacencies directly with the **lisp-encap** option of the **neighbor** command.

First we will look at a CE router configuration.
```
R1(config)# router eigrp TEST
R1(config-router)# address-family ipv4 unicast autonomous-system 100
R1(config-router-af)# neighbor 10.0.0.2 gigabitethernet 0/0/1 remote 3 lisp-encap 1
R1(config-router-af)# network 192.168.0.0
R1(config-router-af)# network 192.168.1.0
R1(config-router-af)# network 192.168.2.0
R1(config-router-af)# end
```
Next we configure the Route Reflector.
```
RR(config)# router eigrp TEST
RR(config-router)# address-family ipv4 unicast autonomous-system 100
RR(config-router-af)# af-interface gigabitethernet 0/0/1
RR(config-router-af-interface)# no next-hop-self
RR(config-router-af-interface)# no split-horizon
RR(config-router-af-interface)# exit
RR(config-router-af)# remote-neighbors source gigabitethernet 0/0/1 unicast-listen lisp-encap 1
RR(config-router-af)# network 192.168.0.0
RR(config-router-af)# end
```

The service provider does not have to run BGP, as long as they have a static default route pointing to the PE router, EIGRP will take care of routing between neighbors.
