We have the ability with key chains to specify multiple keys under a key chain and then define specific accept and send lifetimes for each key. You can think of this as automatic password changes. It helps keep the network secure by changing the EIGRP authentication key string and it does it automatically so you can set it and forget it.
```
R1(config)# key chain ROLLOVER
R1(config-keychain)# key 1
R1(config-keychain-key)# key string blah55
R1(config-keychain-key)# accept-lifetime 00:00:00 Jan 1 2015 01:00:00 Jan 1 2016
R1(config-keychain-key)# send-lifetime 00:00:00 Jan 1 2015 01:00:00 Jan 1 2016
R1(config-keychain-key)# exit
R1(config-keychain)# key 2
R1(config-keychain-key)# accept-lifetime 23:00:00 Dec 31 2015 01:00:00 Jan 1 2017
R1(config-keychain-key)# send-lifetime 23:00:00 Dec 31 2015 01:00:00 Jan 1 2017
R1(config-keychain-key)# exit
!
R1(config)# interface gig0/1
R1(config-if)# ip authentication mode eigrp md5
R1(config-if)# ip authentication key-chain eigrp 100 ROLLOVER
```

It is imperative that routers using rollover key chains synchronize to an NTP source. Even with that, you should still overlap key lifetimes to ensure neighbor adjacencies are not lost. To set up a router as an NTP server, perform the following configuration.
```
R1# clock set hh:mm:ss day month year
R1# clock update-calendar
R1(config)# ntp master 1
R1(config)# exit
```
The **clock set** command sets the software clock and then the **clock update-calendar** command updates the hardware clock to the current software clock time.

To overlap key times, keep the send-lifetime to the desired end date, but extend the accept-lifetime by at least a few minutes.
