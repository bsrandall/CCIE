It is possible to make a router advertise a default route out an interface by using summarization. By using summarization, not only will you advertise a default route, all routes that would normally be advertised out that interface are summarized into the default.

When advertising a default via summarization, the summary route will only be advertised to connected neighbors out the interface you defined the summary. It will then have a discard default route to Null0. In reality the router advertising the summary default would have its own default route installed pointing to an internet router, unless of course it was an internet router with the full routing table.

Compare this to establishing a default route using **ip route 0.0.0.0 0.0.0.0** and then redistributing static. This route will be seen by *all* neighbors (not just those out the summarized interface), and will be viewed as an External EIGRP route with AD 170.
