#### Tcl
To access the Tcl sheel in IOS, use the **tclsh** ECEC command.
```
R1# tclsh
R1(Tcl)# 
```

Tcl has one variable type, the string. To store variables in Tcl, use the **set** command.
```
R1(Tcl)# set x 100
```
To then use the variable in a script, you must preced the variable with a $.
```
R1(Tcl)# expr $x + 10
110
```
**expr** is used to evaluate the expression and return the results.

To view variables, use the **puts** command.
```
R1(Tcl)# puts $x
100
```

You can store procedures in Tcl with the **proc** command:
```
R1(Tcl)# proc myproc {} {
	puts "this is my proc"
}

Control commands availablke in Tcl include **for**, **foreach**, and **while**.

The **if** command is also available.
```
R1(Tcl)# if {$drops == 0} {
	puts "interface has no drops"
	} else {
		puts "interface has $drops drops"}
```
The **switch** comparison operator is also available.

If you are in Tcl mode and you enter a command that the Tcl interpreter does not understand, the command will be passed to the device's normal command handler.
#### Embedded Event Manager (EEM)
Embedded Event Manager (EEM) is a tool available in IOS that allows users to run Tcl scripts directly on Cisco devices. EEM consists of three components:
- Event detectors: monitor the operational state of a process in IOS. There is a long list of event detectors.
- EEM server: a bridge between the event detectors and the policies
- Policies: either Applets ir Tcl scripts

Applets allow you to work with EEM through normal CLI commands, instead of having to know about Tcl scripting.
```
R1(config)# event manager applet TEST
R1(config-applet)# event syslog pattern "Interface GigabitEthernet3/0. changed state to down"
R1(config-applet)# action mail
```
You can set global variables in EEM with the **event manager environment** command:
```
R1(config)# event manager environment MYVAR "Up/Down"
```
Each event detector has its own built in variables as well, which can be viewed with
```
R1# show event manager detector \<NAME\> detailed
```
This same document describes the most common actions used with EEM applets.

Tag values are used if multiple events exist to provide a correlation among the events. If you just have a single event tags are optional.

#### Interface Events
To start an EEM applet, you start by giving it an appropriate name:
```
R1(config)# event manager applet INTERFACE_LOAD
R1(config-applet)# 
```

Next we need to decide which event you wish to monitor. The detectors for interface events are listed below.
```
R1(config-applet)#event interface ?
  average-factor  Period used for rate based calculations
  entry-op        Entry comparison operator
  entry-type      Entry comparison type
  entry-val       Counter value be compared to raise interface event
  exit-comb       Exit combination operator for exit condition tests
  exit-event      Raise an exit event upon exit
  exit-op         Exit comparison operator
  exit-time       Time before event monitoring is reenabled
  exit-type       Exit comparison type
  exit-val        Exit counter value for interface event
  maxrun          Maximum runtime of applet
  name            Interface name
  parameter       Interface counter to monitor
  poll-interval   Interval between consecutive polls in seconds
  ratelimit       Limit trigger to once per given time period
```
You typically a first going to pick an interface by defining a name and then choose a parameter to watch.
```
R1(config-applet)#event interface name GigabitEthernet0/1 parameter ?
  input_errors              Number of damaged packets received
  input_errors_crc          Number of packets received with CRC errors
  input_errors_frame        Number of framing ERR packets received
  input_errors_overrun      Number of overruns and resource errors
  input_packets_dropped     Number of packets dropped from input Q
  interface_resets          Number of times an interface has been reset
  output_buffer_failures    Number of failed buffers
  output_buffer_swappedout  Number of packets swapped to DRAM
  output_errors             Number of packets errored on output
  output_errors_underrun    Number of underruns on output
  output_packets_dropped    Number of packets dropped from output Q
  receive_broadcasts        Number of broadcast packets received
  receive_giants            Number of too large packets received
  receive_rate_bps          Interface receive rate in bits/sec
  receive_rate_pps          Interface receive rate in pkts/sec
  receive_runts             Number of too small packets received
  receive_throttle          Number of times the receiver was disabled
  reliability               Interface reliability as a fraction of 255
  rxload                    Receive rate as a fraction of 255
  transmit_rate_bps         Interface transmit rate in bits/sec
  transmit_rate_pps         Interface transmit rate in pkts/sec
  txload                    Transmit rate as a fraction of 255
```
To measure load, we would need to calculate bandwidth as a percentage of load (255). The next part in defining an interface event has confusing terminology. We need to break down the options clearly.
```
R1(config-applet)#event interface name GigabitEthernet0/1 parameter rxload ?
  average-factor  Period used for rate based calculations
  entry-op        Entry comparison operator
  entry-type      Entry comparison type
  entry-val       Counter value be compared to raise interface event
  exit-comb       Exit combination operator for exit condition tests
  exit-event      Raise an exit event upon exit
  exit-op         Exit comparison operator
  exit-time       Time before event monitoring is reenabled
  exit-type       Exit comparison type
  exit-val        Exit counter value for interface event
  maxrun          Maximum runtime of applet
  poll-interval   Interval between consecutive polls in seconds
  ratelimit       Limit trigger to once per given time period
```
**entry-op** pulls the current interface counter value and compares it (using the comparison operator you supply with **entry-op**) with the **entry-val**, which is the threshold value you supply. The **entry-type** specifies whether this is an absolute value, a changing rate, or an incremenal value.

The default polling interval is 1 second. That can be changed with the **poll-interval** keyword on the event line.

Putting all of this together, let's say we have a 1G port off interface GigabitEthernet0/1 and we want to know when our utilization reaches 800 Mbps. We would need to take 80% of 255 (the load value) to get our **entry-val** of 204. Let's say we want to poll every 10 seconds. Our event line would look like this:
```
R1(config)# event manager applet INTERFACE_LOAD
R1(config-applet)# event interface name GigabitEthernet0/1 parameter rxload entry-op gt entry-val 204 entry-type value poll-interval 10
```
That's it! Not too hard once you understand the terminology.

The next step would be to define an action.
```
R1(config-applet)# action mail server "155.1.146.0" to "noc@INE.com" from "R1@INE.com" subject "Interface Alert" body "R1 had utilization over 800Mbps"
```

Now, to put the applet into effect we must call it from EXEC.
```
R1# event manager run INTERFACE_LOAD
```
