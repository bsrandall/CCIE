OSPF hello packets are packets that an OSPF process sends to its OSPF neighbors to maintain connectivity with those neighbors. The hello packets are sent at a configurable interval (in seconds). The defaults are 10 seconds for an Ethernet link and 30 seconds for a non broadcast link. Hello packets include a list of all neighbors for which a hello packet has been received within the dead interval. The dead interval is also a configurable interval (in seconds), and defaults to four times the value of the hello interval. The value of all hello intervals must be the same within a network. Likewise, the value of all dead intervals must be the same within a network.

These two intervals work together to maintain connectivity by indicating that the link is operational. If a router does not receive a hello packet from a neighbor within the dead interval, it will declare that neighbor to be down.

```
R1(config)# interface GigabitEthernet0/1.146
R1(config-if)# ip ospf hello-interval 5
R1(config)# exit
```
It is important to remember that with OSPF, changing the hello-interval does change the dead-interval automatically.
```
R1#sh ip ospf int gig0/1.146
%SYS-5-CONFIG_I: Configured from console by console
R1#sh ip ospf int gig0/1.146

  Timer intervals configured, Hello 5, Dead 20, Wait 20, Retransmit 5
```
And unlike EIGRP, mismatched hello and dead-interval timers will result in adjacencies failing.
```
