IP fragmenting has long been a security weakness of the IP protocol. Ping of death is an example of an attack that takes advantage of the weakness of IP fragmenting. Because of this it is a good idea to avoid traffic fragmentation in your network.

The default behavior of IP access lists without the **fragment** keyword is to take the action on nonfragmented packets, initial fragments, and noninitial fragments if the access list only contains Layer 3 information. If the access-list contains Layer 3 and Layer 4 information, the entry is applied to nonfragmented packets and initial fragments while no action is taken on noninitial fragments.

If the **fragments** keyword is used in an IP access list, the action (permit or deny) is only applied to noninitial fragments.

So if you are trying to deny traffic, including noninitial fragments, using Layer 3 and Layer 4 identifiers in your access list, then you need two entries:
```
R1(config)# ip access-list extended FRAGMENTS
R1(config-ext-nacl)# 10 deny tcp host 192.168.17.1 any
R1(config-ext-nacl)# 10 deny tcp host 192.168.17.1 any fragments
```
Packet fragments of IP datagrams are considered individual packets, and each counts individually as a packet in access list accounting and violations.
