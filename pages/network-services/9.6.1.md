The IP Precedence accounting feature provides IP Precedence related accounting information, collected on a per-interface (or sub-interface) basis. The information consists of the total number of packets and bytes for each of the eight IP Precedence values, separated by direction (send and receive). The feature does not collect individual IP addresses, just packet count.

For ingress packets, the accounting is performed before CAR is performed on the packet, so the original packet precedence will always be recorded. For egress packets, the accounting is performed after CAR, DWRED, DWFQ, etc are performed on the packet, so the IP precedence value of the packet may have changed from its original ingress state.

CEF is required for IP Precedence accounting. It is supported on VRF interfaces but is *not* supported on Tunnel interfaces.

The necessary command to enable IP Precedence accounting is below.
```
R1(config)# interface GigabitEthernet0/1
R1(config-if)# ip accounting precedence input
R1(config-if)# ip accounting precedence output
R1(config-if)# end
R1# show run | Begin interface

Current configuration : 5407 bytes
!
interface GigabitEthernet0/1
 ip accounting precedence input
 ip accounting precedence output
!
```
Note that you need separate lines to include both input and output IP precedence accounting.

If you need to clear the interface counters to get an idea of current accounting values, use **clear counters interface**. To see the current values use **show interfaces precedence**.
```
router#show interfaces precedence
Serial0/0
  Input
            Precedence 6:    8 packets, 467 bytes
  Output
            Precedence 0:    6 packets, 504 bytes
            Precedence 6:    11 packets, 863 bytes
```
