### OSPF Overview

OSPF is a link-state routing protocol developed by the IETF as a replacement for RIP. It uses Dijkstraâ€™s Shortest Path First algorithm to calculate a loop-free graph describing the shortest path to every known destination.

It is a very hierarchical protocol. Here are some of the items we will review.

There are 4 router types in OSPF:
- Area Router
- Area Border Router
- Backbone Router
- AS Boundary Router

There are 4 Network Types in OSPFv2:
- Point-to-point
- Broadcast
- NBMA
- Point-to-multipoint
- Virtual link

There are 3 types of routes in OSPF:
- intra-area routes
- inter-area routes
- External type 1 (Hot potato)
- External Type 2 (Closest to Destination)
