EIGRP can be configured to filter traffic using a route map and the redistribute or distribute-list command. **redistribute** is used to filter inbound routes from other routing protocols *before* those routes are entered into the EIGRP topology table. **distribute-list** is used to filter routes learned from EIGRP peers before those routes are admitted to the EIGRP topology table, as well as to filter outbound routes before they are shared with EIGRP neighbors. The use of route maps to filter traffic is the same for both autonomous-system configurations and named configurations.

Not all protocols allow you to use route maps with **distribute-list**, but EIGRP does.

#### Route Maps with Tags
```
R1(config)# route-map SET-TAG
R1(config-route-map)# set tag 1
R1(config-route-map)# exit
R1(config)# redistribute rip metric 1 1 1 1 1 route-map SET-TAG
!
R3(config)# route-map DENY-TAG deny 10
R3(config-route-map)# match tag 3
R3(config-route-map)# exit
R3(config)# route-map DENY-TAG permit 20
R3(config-route-map)# exit
R3(config)# router eigrp 100
R3(config-router)# distribute-list route-map DENY-TAG in
```
#### Route Maps with Source-Protocol
```
R1(config)# route-map FILTER-RIP deny 10
R1(config-route-map)# match source-protocol rip
R1(config-route-map)# exit
R1(config)# route-map FILTER-RIP permit 20
R1(config-route-map)# exit
!
R1(config)# router eigrp 100
R1(config-router)# distribute-list route-map FILTER-RIP in
R1(config-router)# exit
```
