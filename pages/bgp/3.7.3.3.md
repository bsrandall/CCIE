We can also use a route-map to change the next-hop IP address of an inbound route, effectively making it look as if the neighbor had used **neighbor next-hop-self** in its configuration.
```
`R1(config)# route-map SET_NEXT_HOP permit 10
R1(config-route-map)# set ip next-hop 155.1.58.8
R1(config-route-map)# exit
R1(config)# router bgp 65535
R1(config-router)# neighbor 155.1.58.8 route-map SET_NEXT_HOP in
R1(config-router)# end
R1# clear ip bgp 155.1.58.8 in
```
