We saw previously that if the same route is advertised from external peers in different autonomous systems, the MEDs of the routes are ignored by the AS receiving the routes.

Normally this is the right default behavior: You do not want to accept “competing” MED values from multiple administrative authorities outside of your (or each others’) control. There are, however, occasional exceptions to the rule. For example, a service provider might have a single customer with multiple ASNs, and that customer might want to influence incoming path selection to those ASNs. The advertised prefix itself might belong to another ASN further downstream (such as 10.20.0.0/16 in our example) or it might be located in one of the single customer’s autonomous systems but reachable across all of the ASNs through “backdoor routes.”

IOS provides a configuration option for such a circumstance. The statement **bgp always-compare-med** causes the router to include MED values in the BGP decision process even if the prefixes are advertised by different ASNs. The command instructs the BGP process to ignore the first AS# in the AS_PATH attributes when comparing MED values.
```
R1(config)# router bgp 64512
R1(config-router)# bgp always-compare-med
R1(config-router)# exit
```
