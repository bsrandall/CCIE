Port Security causes some issues with HSRP configurations. By default, Port Security allows only 1 MAC address to be used across a single physical port. With HSRP, the port has its physical burned-in MAC address but the active port also uses a Virtual MAC address. There are two ways to fix the problem. The first way is we allow more than 1 MAC addresses to communicate across the port.
```
SW1(config)# interface GigabitEthernet0/1
SW1(config-if)# switchport
SW1(config-if)# switchport mode access
SW1(config-if)# switchport port-security
SW1(config-if)# switchport port-security maximum 2
```

Another way we can get around the virtual MAC address problem is by using the **standby use-bia** command in the HSRP configuration. This instructs HSRP to use the burnt-in address as the functional active MAC address, instead of using the virtual MAC address.
```
SW1(config)# interface GigabitEthernet0/1
SW1(config-if)# switchport port-security
SW1(config-if)# standby 1 use-bia
```
