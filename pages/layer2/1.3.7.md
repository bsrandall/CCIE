The spanning tree add-on **spanning-tree etherchannel guard misconfig** has the switch attempt to find misconfiguration problems with port channel configurations and err-disable the ports instead of possibly causing network loops.

EtherChannel misconfiguration guard is avalaible if you are running PVST+, rapid PVST+, or MSTP. It is enabled in global configuration mode.
```
SW1(config)# spanning-tree etherchannel guard misconfig
```
This feature is somewhat of a hack. If you keep receiving BPDUs from several MAC addresses, the feature will assume that you have a bundling problem and shut down the port.
