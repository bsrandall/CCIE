The router configuration command **eigrp log-neighbor-changes** enables the logging of neighbor adjacency changes to monitor the stability of the routing system and to help detect problems. Logging is enabled by default - to disable logging use the **no** form of this command.
```
R1(config)# router eigrp 100
R1(config-router)# no eigrp log-neighbor-changes
R1(config-router)# exit
```

Similar to the eigrp log-neighbor-changes command is the **eigrp log-neighbor-warnings** router configuration command enables logging of neighbor warnings. It is enabled by default as well.
```
R1(config)# router eigrp 100
R1(config-router)# eigrp log-neighbor-warnings 300
R1(config-router)# exit
```
The integer at the end is a timer of how often to repeat the neighbor warning, in seconds.
