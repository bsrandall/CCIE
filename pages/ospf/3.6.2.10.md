Multicast Hellos are sent on Point-to-point, Point-to-Multipoint Broadcast, and Broadcast Network types. Unicast Hellos are sent on NBMA and Point-to-Multipoint Non-Broadcast networks.

When you use the neighbor command on Non Broadcast and Point-to-Multipoint Non-Broadcast networks, you only have to set the neighbor statement on one of the two routers.
