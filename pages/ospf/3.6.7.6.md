This is a very specific filtering solution for a particular problem that exists with Type-7 to Type-5 translation out of NSSAs. Let's say there is an NSSA area we will call area 2. The NSSA has an ASBR with external routes and thus a Type-7 LSA is generated and received by an ABR connected to Area 0. The network design in this case requires that area 2 routes are summarized into the backbone. But if we summarize into the backbone, the ASBR will not be reachable by the other areas because the forwarding address in the translated Type-5 LSA will be the address of the ASBR, but yet nobody will know how to reach the ASBR outside of Area 2.

With Forwarding Address Suppression turned on, the ABR will set the Forwarding Address to 0.0.0.0 in the Type-5 LSA that was translated from the Type-7 NSSA External LSA. A forwarding address set to 0.0.0.0 indicates that packets for the external destination should be forwarded to the advertising OSPF router, in this case, the translating NSSA ABR.
```
R1(config)# router ospf 1
R1(config-router)# area 2 nssa translate type7 suppress-fa
R1(config-router)# exit
```
