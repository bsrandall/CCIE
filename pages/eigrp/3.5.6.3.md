Standard Access Lists are the simplest method to implement route filtering. They can be used in EIGRP with a distribute list, a route map, or an offset list.
```
`R1(config)# ip access-list 10 permit 172.16.0.0 0.0.255.255
R1(config)# router eigrp 100
R1(config-router)# distribute-list 10 gig0/0 in
```
