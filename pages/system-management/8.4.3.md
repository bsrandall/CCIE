For this EEM topic we will be looking at Syslog Events. You will typically use the **pattern** detector for Syslog to match Syslog entries and then take some type of action based on the presence of that entry.

Here is an example.
```
R1(config)# event manager applet INT_SHUT
R1(config-applet)# event syslog pattern "Interface GigabitEthernet0/1.\*changed.\*down"
R1(config-applet)# action 1.0 cli command "enable"
R1(config-applet)# action 2.0 cli command "conf t"
R1(config-applet)# action 3.0 cli command "interface GigabitEthernet0/1"
R1(config-applet)# action 4.0 cli command "no shutdown"
R1(config-applet)# action 5.0 cli command "end"
```
To ensure that your applet registered with the EEM server, use **show venet manager policy registered**.

You can iptionally filter only events of a certain priority by specifying the **severity-level**. If no severity level is supplied, all events will be considered when the log messages are screened for the pattern match.
