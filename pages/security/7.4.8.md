You can use policy based routing to filter certain types of traffic. Among the most used are:
- any access list
- packet size
- the packet ToS byte
- the output interface (great for subinterface granularity)

To drop packets with PBR, us the **set interface Null0** set statement within a route map. It may be helpful to also set **no ip unreachables** under the Null0 interface to avoid unwanted ICMP unreachables messages from being generated when traffic is filtered.

To configure filtering with PBR, use the familiar route-map coupled with the **ip policy route-map** interface command.
```
R1(config)# route-map DROP
R1(config-route-map)# match length 100 100
R1(config-route-map)# set interface Null0
R1(config-route-map)# exit
R1(config)# interface Null0
R1(config-if)# no ip unreachables
R1(config-if)# interface GigabitEthernet0/1
R1(config-if)# ip policy route-map DROP
R1(config-if)# exit
```
The 100 100 on the **match length** line represents minimum and maximum packet size.
