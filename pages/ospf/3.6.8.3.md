As we saw with EIGRP, we can use a tracking object to determine whether a default route should be installed or removed from the routing table with OSPF.
```
ip sla 1
  icmp-echo 155.1.108.10
  frequency 5
!
ip sla schedule 1 life forever start-time now
  track 1 ip sla 1 state
!
ip route 169.254.0.1 255.255.255.255 Null0 track 1
ip prefix-list PLACEHOLDER seq 5 permit 169.254.0.1/32
!
route-map TRACK_PLACEHOLDER permit 10
  match ip address prefix-list PLACEHOLDER
!
router ospf 1
  default-information originate route-map TRACK_PLACEHOLDER
```
A use case for this would be Metro Ethernet where the link status could remain up but IP reachability is down.
