Split horizon is the rule that a router should not advertise a path to a destination through the interface it is using to reach that destination. The theory behind split horizon is there is no need to advertise the cost to the destination in the upstream direction, because the cost should be higher. The upstream routers should already have a lower-cost path available.

EIGRP has split horizon enabled by default on Cisco devices and *all* interface types, compared to RIP which disables split-horizon on Frame Relay and SMDS interfaces by default. Sometimes, this can lead to DUAL not finding an alternative loop-free path, even if one exists. The case for this is usually because one router is not advertising a higher cost path to am upstream neighbor who has a lower cost path to the same destination. The router who is not advertising the higher cost path will still have that path in its EIPGRP topology table, but the upstream router will not. So if it needs a backup route to be installed for the destination network, it will have to go through the Query process to find the alternate route.

WIth classic EIGRP configuration, split horizon is disabled at the interface level.
```
R1(config)# interface GigabitEthernet0/1
R1(config-if)# no ip split-horizon eigrp 100
```
