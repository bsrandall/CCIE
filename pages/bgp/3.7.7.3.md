The well-known NO\_ADVERTISE BGP community signals the BGP speaker not to advertise the particular prefix to any BGP peer. This may be useful to limit the scope of routing information to just directly connected neighbors. In our scenario, we set the community attribute inbound on prefixes received from R10. This makes R2 think that the prefixes should not be advertised to any other peers.
```
R1(config)# route-map SET-COMMUNITY
R1(config-route-map)# set community no-advertise
R1(config-route-map)# exit
R1(config)# router bgp 200
R1(config-router)# neighbor 192.10.1.254 route-map SET-COMMUNITY in
R1(config-router)# exit
```
If you sent it out then the peer would use the route but it would not advertise it to any of its peers.
