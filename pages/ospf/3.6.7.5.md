LSA Type-3 Filtering is used to remove LSAs from the database as advertisements move between areas. In this fashion they are like stub areas, but they can use prefix lists to arbitrarily permit or deny *inter-area* routes. A few items regarding LSA Type-3 Filtering:

- has to be applied on an ABR
- applied when they are generating their inter-area prefixes
- the direction is related to the area for which it is defined
 - for example, **area 3 filter-list prefix AREA_3_OUT out** would filter routes out of area 3 as they headed toward the backbone.

 The command is performed after the ABR has walked through the RIB but before LSA-Type 3 generation, which ensures that Type-3 LSAs are not originated for the provided subnets.

 ```
 R1(config)# router ospf 1
 R1(config-router)# area 2 filter-list prefix in NO_ADVERTISE
 R1(config-router)# exit
 ```
With the prefix list, permit means to allow the route while deny means to filter the route. Just like with distribute lists, you must remember there is an implicit deny at the end of the prefix list so if you are denying routes make sure you permit 0.0.0.0/0 le 32 at the end.

 After the filter-list is applied, the LSAs are withdrawn from the defined areas by the configured router.
