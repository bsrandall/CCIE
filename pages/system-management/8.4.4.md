EEM can also be used to monitor CLI events. Like the syslog event, the cli event also uses **pattern** to do a regex match on entered commands. The *sync* keyword on the cli event defines whether the applet and CLI execution should be synchronous. If set to yes, the EEM server will hold the matched CLI command execution until the script terminates. Asynchronous event handlers will let the CLI command execute and the event will be posted after that.

This example shows how you could use a synchronous cli event to exlude usernames from being shown when a CLI user types the **show run** command.
```
R1(config)# event manager applet SHOW_RUN_FILTER
R1(config-applet)# event cli pattern "show run" sync yes
R1(config-applet)# action 1.0 cli command "enable"
R1(config-applet)# action 2.0 cli command"show run | exclude username"
R1(config-applet)# action 3.0 puts $_cli_result
R1(config-applet)# action 4.0 set $_exit_status 0
```
The final line is a return value that signifies that the original triggered command (show run) should not be run after script completion.
