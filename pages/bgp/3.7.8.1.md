Prefix lists are the most preferable way to filter subnets in BGP based on their IP addressing information. Prefix list is an ordered sequence of entries in which each entry specifies either a single IP prefix or a range of prefixes. Prefix lists are stored in efficient data structures, allowing for very fast lookup and information retrieval. They have certain performance benefits over the standard and extended IOS access-lists when used for prefix filtering. 

Entries in a prefix list are processed sequentially, until the first match. As soon as the match is found, the processing is stopped and the associated action is performed. The \<Subnet\>/\<Prefix\> pair specifies the major subnet that all prefixes matching this entry should belong to. For example, this could be 192.168.0.0/16 or 172.16.8.0/24, any valid classless prefix. The modifiers ge and le are optional and used to specify a prefix range. Specifically, a prefix matches the entry if: 
1. The prefix is a subnet of \<Subnet\>/\<Prefix\>. That is, the prefix subnet is a subset of and prefix-length is greater than or equal to \<Prefix\>. So, for **192.168.0.0/16**, 192.168.17.1/25, 192.168.99.1/32, and 192.168.0.0/24 are all valid subsets, but 192.167.254.254/25 is not.
2. The prefix length is less than or equal to \<Length2\>. That is, if the le modifier is used the prefix length must be within the \|\<Prefix\>, \<Length2\>\| range. For example for **192.168.0.0/16 le 24**, 192.168.2.0/24 or 192.168.5/0/22 will match but 192.168.3.128/25 will not.
3. The prefix length is greater than or equal to \<Length1\> but less than 32 if the ge modifier is used. That is, the prefix length must be within the \|\<Length1\>, 32| range. 	.Take, for example, the prefix-list entry 172.16.3.0/24 ge 25 . It would match 172.16.3.128/25, 172.16.3.0/30, and 172.16.3.1/32, but not 172.16.3.0/24.

If both le and ge are used, the resulting prefix-length range is between \<Length1\> and \<Length2\>, inclusive.

To match the default route, use **0.0.0.0/0** and to match all prefixes use **0.0.0.0/0 le 32**.

Prefix lists could be applied directly to a BGP peer using the command **neighbor prefix-list PREFIX-LIST [in|out]** or a route- map matching the prefix-list. The latter is preferable because it allows for more flexible policy editing.

`R1(config)# ip prefix-list TEST1 permit 0.0.0.0/0 le 22
R1(config)# ip prefix-list TEST2 permit 192.168.0.0/16
R1(config)# route-map ROUTE-PREFIX-LIST permit 10
R1(config-route-map)# match ip address prefix-list TEST1
R1(config-route-map)# exit
R1(config)# router bgp 200
R1(config-router)# neighbor 10.0.0.0 prefix-list TEST1 in
R1(config-router)# neighbor 192.168.0.1 route-map TEST2 out
R1(config-router)# exit
