The well-known community Local-AS, or NO\_EXPORT\_SUBCONFED in IETF RFC terms, serves the same purpose as the NO\_EXPORT community, but within a sub- confederation boundaries. That is, prefixes tagged by this community are not advertised to external sub-confederation peers (that is, peers in other sub- confederations) AND to regular eBGP peers. In effect, the prefix is contained within a single sub-confederation. The use of Local-AS community is the same as of NO\_EXPORT community, but only within the single confederation boundaries. For example, you may use it for routing optimization toward prefixes aggregated within a sub-confederation.
