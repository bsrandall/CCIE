With the **passive-interface** EIGRP command, the effect is to cease sending and processing hellos on the indicated interfaces. This cause neighbor relationships to not form or expire, effectively stopping both inbound and outbound routes from being shared. If you only want to suppress outbound routes from being sent, then you should use a distribute list instead.
```
`R1(config)# ip access-list 20 deny any
R1(config)# router eigrp 100
R1(config-router)# distribute-list 20 out gig0/0
```
`With the above configuration, hellos are still sent out the interface, allowing neighbor adjacencies to form, and thus inbound routes will be learned. However, the distribute list will prevent the sharing of any outbound routes.
