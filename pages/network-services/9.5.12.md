It is stated in many places that NVI, or NAT Virtual Interface, is the new version of NAT. The Cisco documentation instead defines it as "NVI is designed for traffic from one VRF to another and not for routing between subnets in the global routing table." So the documentation makes it appear as though its main purpose is to translate between two VRFs.

With NVI you do not have to define an inside and an outside interface. Everything is viewed as either source or destination. You use **ip nat enable** on the interfaces that traffic flows through and then define your translations.
```
R1(config)# interface GigabitEthernet0/1
R1(config-if)# ip address 100.100.100.1 255.255.255.248
R1(config-if)# ip nat enable
R1(config-if)# exit
R1(config)# interface GigabitEthernet0/2
R1(config-if)# ip address 192.168.17.1 255.255.255.0
R1(config-if)# ip nat enable
R1(config-if)# exit
R1(config)# access-list 10 permit 192.168.17.0 0.0.0.255
R1(config)# ip nat pool OUTSIDE 100.100.100.4 100.100.100.7 prefix 30 add-route
R1(config)# end
```
Notice the **add-route** statement at the end of the NAT pool - this is required with NVIs.

The NAT direction is always inside for an NVI. This means that a route lookup is always performed before the translation.

 NAT Virtual Interfaces (NVIs) are not supported in the Cisco IOS XE software. Also note that NVI does not support route maps and in some versions of IOS it does not support SNAT.
