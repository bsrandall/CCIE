Neighbors with the lowest BGP router identifier will establish the connection to the remote peer via TCP port 179, the source port will be random. This makes the remote peer the TCP server, since its connection is to port 179, and therefore the router with the lowest router-id will be the client. We can modify this behavior with a few simple commands.
```
R1(config)#router bgp 100
R1(config-router)#neighbor 10.0.0.2 transport connection-mode ?
active   Actively establish the TCP session
passive  Passively establish the TCP session
```
The end that is active will be the TCP server. The comments I read is that this is rarely done in production, and perhaps the only case would be if one side was behind a firewall and needed its inbound connection to be over a predictable port (179).
