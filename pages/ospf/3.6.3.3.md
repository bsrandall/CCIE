With Cisco IOS, the OSPF cost value is derived from the bandwidth, changing the bandwidth at the interface level changes the cost. I could not find any reason to alter the metric via changing an interface bandwidth compared to just directly altering it via the **ip ospf 1 cost** interface configuration command.
