#### Filtering overview
Filters can only be applied at very specific points in the OSPF network. This is vastly different from the other IGPs we have studies thus far. Most of the time, this OSPF filtering is done on the ABRs. We are not filtering out the LSA from the Link State Database - we are simply preventing the route from being installed in the routing table.

When we are filtering between areas, there are a couple of methods:
- Filtering with Summarization
- LSA Type-3 Filtering
- NSSA ABR External Prefix Filtering
- Transit prefix suppression

The actual OSPF RIB can be filtered anywhere However this can be dangerous as it does not stop the flooding of LSAs within the area. These are the tools with which to accomplish.
- Distribute-list with ACL
- Distribute-list with Route-map
- Administrative Distance

There is only one way we can actually filter the Link State Database. There are the commands **ip ospf database-filter all out** or **neighbor 10.10.10.1 database-filter all out** that prevents the OSPF process from sending out any LSAs to those adjacencies. This should only be done if you are sure the LSAs are being flooded to those routers by other means. The purpose of this feature is to limit the amount of flooding on NBMA subnets shared by many routers, not to prevent any router from receiving area LSAs.


#### Distribute-Lists
Distribute-lists work by preventing optimal paths as calculated by OSPF from entering the RIB. They are used to filter inter-area routes learned by an ABR from area 0 from being installed in the RIB of a particular area. Distribute-lists do not filter LSAs, so extreme caution has to be used - you need to make sure that all routers in the forwarding path of the routes have the distribute-lists installed, or else routing loops might occur. You can see below that we can use access lists, prefix lists, or route maps with the distribute-list command.

```
R1(config)#router ospf 1
R1(config-router)#distribute-list ?
  <1-199>      IP access list number
  <1300-2699>  IP expanded access list number
  WORD         Access-list name
  gateway      Filtering incoming updates based on gateway
  prefix       Filter prefixes in routing updates
  route-map    Filter prefixes based on the route-map
```
When using access lists and prefix lists, deny statements prevent the routes from being installed in the local router's route table, at least via OSPF.
