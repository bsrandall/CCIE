Point-to-point networks connect a single pair of routers. A point-to-point rule is that there can only be one neighbor on the link. If there is more than one interface, then you should use the point-to-multipoint network type. Valid neighbors on a point-to-point network always become adjacent. The destination network of all OSPF packets is 224.0.0.5.

Neighbor discovery is straightforward. Hello packets are sent to 224.0.0.5 and if valid types, an adjacency between the neighbors occur. The Point-to-Point network type supports the adjacency of exactly two neighbors on a segment.

Point-to-point is the common case in the OSPF specification. At the time it was developed, serial links were the norm when connecting routers It is the default OSPF network type on point-to-point medias including:
- HDLC
- PPP
- GRE
