Dynamic NAT is by nature reversible. Once the dynamic entry is in the NAT table, traffic from the outside can flow to destinations in the inside without restriction. However, when you use route maps with NAT rules, extendable entries are created, which disallows an external user from opening a reverse connection back to an inside host as no one-to-one mapping exists in the NAT table. When you use the **reversible** keyword, one-to-one mappings are created along with the extendable entries when using route maps.
```
R1(config)# route-map EXTENDABLE
R1(config-route-map)# match ip address 10
R1(config-route-map)# exit
R1(config)# ip nat pool POOL 100.100.100.100 100.100.100.200 prefix-length 24
R1(config)# ip nat inside source route-map EXTENDABLE pool POOL reversible
R1(config)# end
```
