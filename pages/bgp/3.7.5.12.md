We saw previously that BGP may implement equal-cost load balancing across multiple paths if the paths meet some criteria.
- Have the same set of path attributes up to the MED
- Are of the same type
- Have the same IGP cost to reach their NEXT\_HOP IP address

If all the above conditions are met and **maximum-paths** is configured under the BGP process, BGP will install multiple equal-cost routes into the local RIB and use them for load balancing. There is an optional **ibgp** keyword to indicate that you want to use **maximum-paths** internally.
```
`R1(config)# router bgp 200
R1(config-router)# maximum-paths 4
R1(config-router)# exit
```
