Command aliases in IOS can be used as shortcuts for commonly used commands. Usually these are configured for commands from exec, global configuration, or interface mode. The keywords **exec**, **configure**, and **interface** will set which mode the alias applies to.
```
R1(config)# alias exec ri show ip route
R1(config)# alias configure iae ip access-list extended
R1(config)# alias interface si service-policy input
```
