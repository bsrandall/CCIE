We mentioned before that SNMP Traps and informs accomplish the same thing, it is just that Traps notify the NMS of events in a reliable fashion, even though the underlying transport is still UDP. This does come at the cost of additional overhead, as the inform message is queued in router memory until the NMS acknowledges its receipt.

Traps can be configured globally or per host. Host settings will override any global settings. There are some traps that can only be sent globally, such as link up and down notifications. In this case traps are sent to all hosts, unless overriden. To send traps to a particular host you would need these lines:
```
R1(config)# snmp-server enabled traps snmp linkdown linkup
R1(config)# snmp-server host 155.1.146.1 CISCO
```

If you then wanted to override this trap for a particular host, you could use this:
```
R1(config)# no snmp-server host 155.1.146.2 traps CISCO snmp linkdown linkup


For informs, the same notifications enabled globally with **snmp-server enable traps** will be sent as informs to hosts enabled for informs.
```
R1(config)# snmp-server host 155.1.146.3 inform version 2c CISCO
``

The same host could be configured with hosts and informs, but this configuration is uncommon.
