SSH runs on top of TCP and provides strong authentication and encryption capabilities. SSH provides a means to securely access and securely execute commands on another computer or device over a network.

Cisco IOS by default uses version 1.99, which allows support for SSHv1 and SSHv2. Since SSHv1 is considered to be insecure, it is recommended to disable SSHv1 by explicitly configuring version 2:
```
R1(config)# ip ssh version 2
```
You must configure a hostname and domain name when using SSH. Here would be a full operating example:
```
R1(config)# hostname R1
R1(config)# ip domain-name cisco.com
R1(config)# crypto key generate rsa
R1(config)# ip ssh time-out 120
R1(config)# ip ssh authentication retries 5
R1(config)# ip ssh version 2
R1(config)# ip ssh rekey time 108
R1(config)# line vty 0 4
R1(config-line)# transport input ssh
```

To verify your input, use **show ip ssh**.
