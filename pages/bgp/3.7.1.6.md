BGP relies upon TCP for its MD5 authentication. This makes authentication pretty straightforward.
```
R1(config)# router bgp 100
R1(config-router)# neighbor 198.14.27.2 remote-as 200
R1(config-router)# neighbor 198.14.27.2 password CISCO
R1(config-router)# exit
```
The two troubleshooting messages are also straightforward. “No MD5 Digest” indicates that one peer does not have a password defined while the other does. “Invalid MD5 Digest” informs us that the peer password does not match.

It is best practice for each eBGP peer to have a different password.

Remember that BGP is just a TCP application, and for authentication it is using TCP for authentication. You can use TCP show commands to validate the configuration:
pre><code>R200# show tcp brief
TCB       Local Address               Foreign Address             (state)
05E29840  192.0.2.1.13297             192.0.2.2.179               ESTAB
R200#show tcp tcb 05E29840
