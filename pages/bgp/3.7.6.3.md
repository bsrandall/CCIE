As you learned in the previous scenario, BGP summarization using the **aggregate-address** command creates new prefixes in the BGP table but does not suppress the advertisement of the specific prefixes that make up the summary. To generate just the summary prefix, use the option **summary-only** after the **aggregate-address** command. The BGP process will automatically suppress advertisement of the prefixes in the BGP table encompassed by the new summary address. This is probably the most common use of the aggregation command, because usually only the summarized prefix should be advertised.
```
R1(config)# router bgp 64512
R1(config-router)# network 10.0.0.0 mask 255.255.255.0
R1(config-router)# network 10.0.1.0 mask 255.255.255.0
R1(config-router)# network 10.0.2.0 mask 255.255.255.0
R1(config-router)# network 10.0.3.0 mask 255.255.255.0
R1(config-router)# aggregate-address 10.0.0.0 255.255.252.0 summary-only
R1(config-router)# exit
```
The suppressed prefixes due to the aggregate will have an “s” in the BGP table.
