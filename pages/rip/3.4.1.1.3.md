Split Horizon in routing means that we do not advertise routes back to a neighbor that we learned from him. With RIP, this is generalized at the interface level.

Sometimes, with multiaccess networks this may be an issue. If you are learning routes at a hub site of a frame relay or MPLS network, if you do not advertise those routes back out the same interface (the WAN hub circuit), then none of the spokes will learn about other spokes. With RIP, the only way to get around this is to disable split horizon. This is done on a per-interface basis.
```
R1(config)# interface GigabitEthernet0/1
R1(config-if)# no ip split-horizon
```
Split horizon is enabled by default for all network types except Frame Relay.

If you do disable split-horizon, it would be a good idea to implement route filters to prevent a router from sending updates to particular spokes that it learned from that spoke.

To see if split-horizon is enabled or disabled on an interface, use the **show ip interface** command.

R5(config-if)#do sh ip int tunnel 0
