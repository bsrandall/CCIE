SOO uniquely identifies the site that originates a route. It is a BGP extended community that prevents routing loops or suboptimal routing, specifically when a backdoor is present between VPN sites. SOO provides loop prevention in networks with dual-homed sites (sites that are connected to two or more PE routers). You can use it when an IGP is the PE-CE routing protocol. You can also use it when BGP is used between PE and CE, when the as-path loop prevention cannot be trusted anymore. This happens when BGP uses as-override or allowas-in. If the SOO is configured for a CE router and a vpnv4 route is learned with the same SOO, the route must not be put in the VRF routing table on the PE and advertised to the CE.

SOO is set in a route map.
```
PE1(config)# route-map SOO permit 10
PE1(config-route-map)# set extcommunity soo 1:100
```
If SOO is applied for BGP, it is used in the BGP **neighbor** command.
```
PE1(config)# router bgp 100
PE1(config-router)# address-family ipv4 vrf BLUE
PE1(config-router-af)# redistribute connected
PE1(config-router-af)# neighbor 10.10.2.1 remote-as 65001
PE1(config-router-af)# neighbor 10.10.2.1 activate
PE1(config-router-af)# neighbor 10.10.2.1 route-map SOO in
PE1(config-router-af)# exit
```
Note in BGP you can also set the SoO without using a route map, using the **neighbor** command.
```
PE1(config-router-af)# neighbor 10.10.2.1 soo 100:1
```
