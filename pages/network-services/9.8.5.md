An IP directed broadcast is an IP packet whose destination address is a valid broadcast address for some IP subnet but which originates from a node that is not itself part of that destination subnet. If directed broadcasts are enabled, any remote host can send a broadcast to a LAN subnet's directed broadcast address, and the packet would be translated to the Layer 2 broadcast sent to ffff.ffff.ffff. It is obviously recommended to disable this feature.
```
R1(config)# interface GigabitEthernet0/1
R1(config-if)# no ip directed-broadcast
R1(config-if)# end
```

The UDP forward feature takes certain broadcast UDP packets and changes the destination addres to a unicast or directed broadcast address. By default, the router will forward UDP packets only for the following protocols:
- TACACS (not TACACS+)
- TFTP
- BOOTP
- Time
- NetBIOS
- Name Server (obsolete)
- DNS

All are enabled by default and you can disable them with:
