We spoke about this previously in the CPPr topic. CPPr divides the aggregate control plane into 3 subinterfaces, with *host* being one of them.
```
R1(config)# control-plane host
R1(config-cp-host)# service-policy input POLICY_NAME
R1(config)# exit
```

The service-policy refers to a policy map that was created in MQC style.
