Offset Lists can be used to increase incoming and outgoing metrics to routes learned via EIGRP or RIP. Like a distribute-list, you can use an access-list to limit the range of routes affected. Unlike a distribute list, you cannot use a prefix list to define the routes to be adjusted.

Offset lists alter the *delay* metric of the routes learned or shared while distribute lists completely filter the route from being learned or shared.

```
R1(config)# access-list 21 permit 172.16.0.0 0.0.255.255
R1(config)# router eigrp 100
R1(config-router)# offset-list 21 in 1000 gig0/0
R1(config-router)# exit
```
The above configuration would add 1000 to the calculated metric received for inbound routes learned on interface GigabitEthernet0/0 matching 172.16.0.0/16.
