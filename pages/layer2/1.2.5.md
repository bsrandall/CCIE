VTP version 3 supports Private VLANs. Before this support was added, any switches that used Private VLANs had to be in VTP transparent more or have VTP off. This created issues for two reasons. First, if you needed to run private VLANs, that basically precluded you from learning about other VLANs or centrally administering VLANs on those switches which contained Private VLANs. Second, you had to manually configure Private VLANs across switches - there was no way to centrally administer and thus to way for switches to automatically learn Private VLAN configuration.

With VTP version 3, the Private VLAN associations are carried across switches. It does not carry any trunk assignments. The below should make that clear.
```
SW1(config-vlan)#vlan 601
SW1(config-vlan)# private-vlan isolated
SW1(config-vlan)#
SW1(config-vlan)# vlan 600
SW1(config-vlan)# private-vlan primary
SW1(config-vlan)# private-vlan association 601
```
Even if we configured port or trunk roles, that information will not be transported across VTP version 3, only the above.
```
SW1#show vlan private-vlan

Primary Secondary Type              Ports
------- --------- ----------------- ------------------------------------------
600     601       isolated

SW2#show vlan private-vlan

Primary Secondary Type              Ports
------- --------- ----------------- ------------------------------------------
600     601       isolated          Fa0/6
```
