DRs were incorporated into OSPF to solve two issues:
- the formation of adjacencies between every attached router would create many unnecessary LSAs. If there are n routers there would be n(n-1)/2 adjacencies and each router would flood n-1 LSAs, plus 1 LSA for the network, resulting in n^2 LSAs
- flooding would be ridiculous and there would exist multiple copies of the same LSA on the network at any given time.

The Designated Router thus has two responsibilities on a multi-access network.
- Represent the multi-access network and its attached routers to the rest of the OSPF area
- Manage the flooding process on the multi-access network
