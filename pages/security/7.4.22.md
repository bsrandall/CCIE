The IPv6 First Hop Security feature is similar to IP Source Guard for IPv4. It relies on the IPv6 neighbor binding table created by IPv6 Snooping. It creates an automatic PACL to filter sources based on the neighbor binding table. Therefore any traffic from hosts not known to the binding table will be filtered.

SW1(config)# ipv6 source-guard policy ALL_HOSTS
SW1(config-sisf-sourceguard)# permit link-local
SW1(config-sisf-sourceguard)# deny global-autoconf
SW1(config-sisf-sourceguard)# exit
SW1(config)# interface range GigabitEthernet0/2-22
SW1(config-if-range)# ipv6 source-guard attach-policy ALL_HOSTS
SW1(config-if-range)# end
```
The **deny global-autoconf** statement denies traffic from auto-configured global addresses.
