Unlike weight which only applies to the preference for the local router, *Local Preference* is carried throughout the autonomous system. It is carried in routing updates to other local peers, but the attribute is stripped from updates before the route is advertised to external peers. Of all the BGP path attributes manipulated for setting routing policy, LOCAL_PREF is probably the most commonly used._

A routeâ€™s LOCAL_PREF attribute can be any number between 0 and 4294967295; the higher the number, the more preferable the route. By default, all routes advertised to IBGP peers have a LOCAL_PREF of 100. This default value can be changed with the ip default local-preference statement. The LOCAL_PREF attribute of individual routes is changed by using a route map and the statement **set local-preference**.
```
R1(config)# ip prefix-list ROUTES seq 5 permit 10.20.0.0/16
R1(config)# route-map SET-PREF permit 10
R1(config-route-map)# match ip address prefix-list ROUTES
R1(config-route-map)# set local-preference 500
R1(config-route-map)# exit
R1(config)# router bgp 64512
R1(config-router)# neighbor 10.100.17.2 remote-as 64512
R1(config-router)# neighbor 10.100.17.2 route-map SET-PREF in
R1(config-router)# exit
```
When you manipulate the local preference path attribute, you affect the way in which traffic leaves the local AS. Typically, local preference is modified at the border of the AS, at the point of external connection.
