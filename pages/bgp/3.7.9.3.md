Private AS numbers in the range 64512â€“65535 are often assigned to small enterprises that use BGP to peer with their ISPs. Private AS numbers are similar to RFC 1918 IP addressing, which allows for consuming AS numbers on the Internet. However, private AS numbers should not appear on the public Internet, because many sites may originate the same number. Thus, the AS that provides upstream connection for the private site should remove the private AS numbers from the AS_PATH attribute.

The command to perform the AS_PATH stripping in IOS is **neighbor \<IP\> remove- private-as**. All BGP updates sent over this session are inspected to have a sequence of private AS numbers in the beginning of the AS_PATH. All private numbers are then removed, and the local AS number is prepended. In situations where the private AS sequence is not located in the beginning of the AS_PATH, the stripping will not work and the AS_PATH will remain unmodified.
```
R1(config)# router bgp 64512
R1(config-router)# neighbor 155.1.0.5 remote-as 200
```
```
R5(config)# router bgp 200
R5(config-router)# neighbor 155.1.0.1 remote-as 64512
R5(config-router)# neighbor 155.1.0.1 remove-private-as
R5(config-router)# exit
```
Note that the **remove-private-as** command applies to egress routes, and therefore is applied at egress points of the network.
