The **neighbor next-hop-self** command causes the outer to change the BGP NEXT_HOP attribute to its own loop- back address in all eBGP routes advertised to the specified iBGP neighbor. It is useful when the IGP knows how to get to the border router but does not know how to get to an external facing address.

With IGPs there is rarely a need for such a feature as almost all routes are learned from a connected neighbor. But with iBGP, a BGP speaker may learn routes from an internal peer that is multiple hops away. While you can be sure that the far end peer has a path to the advertising peer (or else the BGP session would not be up), there is no guarantee that the peer has reachability to the original next-hop address of the route advertisement.

To ensure that this disconnect does not adversely affect the actual forwarding of traffic, the BGP process internally performs the route recursion process for all prefixes toward performing Bestpath selection. If route recursion is not successful (such as if the final outgoing interface cannot be found), the prefix cannot be considered for Bestpath selection. This implies that the prefix cannot be installed in the IP routing table, nor can it be advertised to any other BGP peers.

The Next_Hop attribute identifies the next-hop IP address to be used as the BGP next hop to the destination. The router makes a recursive lookup to find the BGP next hop in the routing table. In external BGP (eBGP), the next hop is the IP address of the peer that sent the update. Internal BGP (iBGP) sets the next-hop address to the IP address of the peer that advertised the prefix for routes that originate internally. When any routes to iBGP that are learned from eBGP are advertised, the Next_Hop attribute is unchanged.
