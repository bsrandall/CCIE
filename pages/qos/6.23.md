As with Voice-Adaptive Traffic Shaping, this is a legacy topic and we will spend minimal time on it.

Frame Relay voice-adaptive fragmentation enables a router to fragment large data packets whenever packets (usually voice) are detected in the low latency queueing priority queue or H.323 call setup signaling packets are present. When there are no packets in the priority queue for a configured period of time and signaling packets are not present, fragmentation is stopped. It is configured on the interface or on a frame-relay map.
```
R1(config)# interface GigabitEthernet0/1
R1(config-if)# frame-relay fragment 80
R1(config-if)# end
```
