EIGRP by default limits itself to consuming no more than 50% of the available bandwidth available on a link. EIGRP accomplishes this by pacing its packets. It accomplishes this pacing by the following process:
- calculate how long it takes to send a single bit on the link
- multiply that number by the size of the packet ready to be sent
- wait this amount of time (or a portion / multiple of this time) before sending the packet

On multipoint non-broadcast interfaces, the bandwidth available is divided by the number of neighbors reachable through that interface.

Pacing rate can be configured on a per interface basis.
```
R1(config-if)# ip bandwidth-percent eigrp 100 \<1-999999\>
```
