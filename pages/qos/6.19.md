All of the shaping examples we saw previously used the **shape average** command. In this topic we will discuss the **shape peak** command.

Remember from previous discussion that with shaper logic Bc bits are sent each Tc. If there is a period of low or no activity and the Shaper has been configured with a Be value, then for a short time, Be bits more than Bc can be sent.

With **shape peak**, the shaper allows Bc and Be bits to be sent in each interval, even if there has not been a period of little or no activity. When **shape peak** is configured, the shaper is configured so that you can send Bc + Be bits every interval, regardless of the previous interval's usage. Put another way, every interval the bucket is filled with Bc plus Be bits.

To calculate the actual rate the traffic is shaped, which will be higher than the configured rate, use this formula:

Shaping_Rate = Configured_Rate (1 + $$\frac{Be}{Bc}$$)

One other note, with CB Shaping, Bc defaults to 8000 at speeds lower than 320 kbps.
