This will be a collection on routing protocol authentication. By assembling in one place, we can quickly see the differences.

### RIP
RFC 1723 for RIPv2 provided for only plain text passwords. This was achieved by reducing the available number of routes in a RIP message from 25 to 24 and including the plain text password in the first route entry. However, there is an Authentication Type field in the RIPv2 message format, and Cisco takes advantage of this to provide better security.

Cisco decided to offer MD5 authentication by using the first and *last* route entries of a RIP message for MD5 authentication. The Authentication Type for this is 3.

The implementation of RIPv2 authentication requires the use of a key chain. The key chain and mode are then specified under interface configuration mode.
**R1 Configuration:**
```
key chain Tewa
 key 1
 key-string Kachina
interface Ethernet 0
 ip rip authentication key-chain Tewa
 ip rip authentication mode md5
```
**R2 Configuration:**
```
key chain Keres
 key 1
 key-string Kachina
interface Ethernet 0
 ip rip authentication key-chain Keres
 ip rip authentication mode md5
```
Notice that the key chain names are only locally significant - only the key-strings have to match.

### EIGRP

EIGRP also uses key chains for authentication. EIGRP originally only supported MD5 authentication. Below is a sample configuration.
**R1 Configuration:**
```
key chain Tewa
 key 1
 key-string Kachina
interface Ethernet 0
 ip authentication key-chain eigrp 10 Tewa
 ip authentication mode eigrp 10 md5
```
**R2 Configuration:**
```
key chain Keres
 key 1
 key-string Kachina
interface Ethernet 0
 ip authentication key-chain eigrp 10 Keres
 ip authentication mode eigrp 10 md5
```
In the configuration, 10 is the EIGRP autonomous system number. Notice that compared to RIP, the authentication command precedes the routing protocol name.

EIGRP now also supports HMAC-SHA-256 Authentication. There is no key support for HMAC-SHA-256, so a password has to be declared within the af-interface as below.
```
R1(config)# router eigrp testing
R1(config-router)# address-family ipv4 autonomous-system 100
R1(config-router-af)# af-interface gig0/1
R1(config-router-af-interface)# authentication mode hmac-sha-256 0 cisco
```

### OSPF Authentication

OSPF supports three types of authentication.
1. Null Authentication - this is also called Type 0 and it means no authentication information is included in the packet header. It is the default.
2. Plain Text Authentication - This is called Type 1 and it uses simple clear-text passwords.
3. MD5 Authentication - This is called Type 2 and it uses MD5 cryptographic passwords

OSPF, unlike EIGRP and RIP, do not use key chains for authentication. OSPF authentication is accomplished in two parts. First you set the authentication type for an area - if you do not set the authentication type, Type 0 is assumed. The authentication type must be the same for all routers in an area. The authentication password for all OSPF routers on a network must be the same if they are to communicate with each other via OSPF. Second, after setting the OSPF area authentication type, you must set the authentication key in interface configuration mode.


 A sample configuration is below for clear text authentication.
**R1 Configuration:**
```
router ospf 10
 network 172.16.0.0 0.0.255.255 area 0
 area 0 authentication
!
interface Ethernet 0
 ip ospf authentication-key cisco
```
**R2 Configuration:**
```
router ospf 10
 network 172.16.0.0 0.0.255.255
 area 0 authentication
!
interface Ethernet 0
 ip ospf authentication-key cisco
```

If we want to use MD5 authentication, we specify message-digest in both the OSPF router configuration as well as the interface configuration.
**R1 Configuration:**
```
router ospf 10
 network 172.16.0.0 0.0.255.255 area 0
 area 0 authentication message-digest
!
interface Ethernet 0
 ip ospf message-digest-key 1 md5 cisco
```
**R2 Configuration:**
```
router ospf 10
 network 172.16.0.0 0.0.255.255
 area 0 authentication message-digest
 !
interface Ethernet 0
 ip ospf message-digest-key 1 md5 cisco
```
