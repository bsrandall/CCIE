Basic eBGP peering is established in two steps.
1. Establish the BGP process with the **router bgp AS** command where AS is the router’s local autonomous system.
2. Specify a neighbor and the neighbor’s AS with the **neighbor remote-as** command.
```
R1(config)# router bgp 100
R1(config-router)# neighbor 122.17.11.24 remote-as 200
```
It is always assumed with eBGP that the neighbors are physically connected and therefore the TTL is set to 1. We will see later that eBGP-multihop is used if it is not a point-to-point connection between the peers.

The IOS default settings ensure that external BGP peers are directly connected by two means:
1. Setting a TTL value of 1 in packets containing BGP messages to external neighbors so that if the packet crosses a router hop the TTL is decremented to 0 and the packet is dropped.
2. Checking the IP address of the configured neighbor to ensure that it belongs to a directly connected subnet.
