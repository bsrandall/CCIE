Control plane policing (CoPP) allows you to control the rate for traffic destined to or originated from the router process. In order to control the traffic you must define traffic classes using MQC syntax and apply a special control-plane policy-map. The only applicable policy-map actions are drop and police. For classification, you may use an IP access-list with DSCP/IP precedence matching. You can also match protocol ARP in the class-maps. You should not rely on NBAR, as you will get unpredictable results.

For policing, use the command **police rate \<N\> pps , in which you can specify the aggregate rate for a class in packets per second.

```
R1(config)# ip access-list extended ICMP
R1(config-ext-acl)# permit icmp any any
R1(config)# class-map ARP
R1(config-cmap)# match protocol arp
R1(config-cmap)# exit
R1(config)# class-map ICMP
R1(config-cmap)# match access-group name ICMP
R1(config-cmap)# exit
R1(config)# class-map ROUTING
R1(config-cmap)# match ip precedence 6
R1(config-cmap)# exit
R1(config)# policy-map CPP
R1(config-pmap)# class ARP
R1(config-pmap-c)# police rate 100 pps
R1(config-pmap-c)# class ICMP
R1(config-pmap-c)# police rate 10 pps
R1(config-pmap-c)# class ROUTING
R1(config-pmap-c)# police rate 50 pps
R1(config-pmap-c)# exit
R1(config-pmap)# exit
R1(config)# control-plane
R1(config-cp)# service-policy input CPP
R1(config-cp)# exit
```

CoPP is applied to all packets that punt to the route processor. Unlike interface access lists, they do not affect every packet that enters the interface. CoPP does not affect data, services, or management traffic.

In this sense, CoPP protects the route processor on network devices by treating route processor resources as a separate entity with its own ingress interface. This is how CoPP is only applied to those packets within the control plane.
