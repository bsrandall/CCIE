When using an extended access list with BGP, the source subnet and source mask fields are used to identify the prefix subnet while the destination subnet and destination mask are used to identify the prefix subnet mask. Here are some examples with an explanation
```
permit ip 10.0.0.0 0.0.0.0 255.255.0.0 0.0.0.0
- this would match 10.0.0.0/16 only
```
````
permit ip 10.0.0.0 0.255.255.255 255.255.255.128 0.0.0.127
- matches 10.x.x.x/25 to 10.x.x.x/32
```
Like we saw with standard access-lists, extended access-lists are implemented with a **neighbor distribute-list** command under the BGP process.

Using access lists as route filters are operationally difficult as we are using a tool that was developed for packet identification to instead identify routes.
