By default, a RIP process on  a Cisco router sends only RIPv1 messages but listens to both RIPv1 and RIPv2 messages. If you leave RIP at its Version 1 default in IOS, you will see the following when using **show ip protocols**:
```
R10(config-router)#do sh ip prot | sec rip
Routing Protocol is "rip"
  Outgoing update filter list for all interfaces is not set
  Incoming update filter list for all interfaces is not set
  Sending updates every 30 seconds, next due in 27 seconds
  Invalid after 180 seconds, hold down 180, flushed after 240
  Redistributing: rip
  Default version control: send version 1, receive any version
    Interface             Send  Recv  Triggered RIP  Key-chain
    GigabitEthernet0/1.10 1     1 2
    GigabitEthernet0/1.10 1     1 2
    Loopback0             1     1 2
  Automatic network summarization is not in effect

  Routing for Networks:
    150.1.0.0
     155.1.0.0
    155.1.0.0
  Routing Information Sources:

    155.1.108.8          120      00:00:13
  Distance: (default is 120)
  ```
If you set RIP to use Version 2, then both Send and Recv above will be set to 2 only.


There are interface-level compatibility commands that should be utilized when working in an environment that uses both versions of RIP.
```
interface Ethernet0
 ip address 192.168.50.129 255.255.255.192
 ip rip send version 1
 ip rip receive version 1
!
interface Ethernet1
 ip address 172.25.150.193 255.255.255.240
 ip rip send version 1 2
!
interface Ethernet2
 ip address 172.25.150.225 255.255.255.240
!
router rip
 version 2
 network 172.25.0.0
 network 192.168.50.0
```
If you want the Router to default to RIPv2, then specify the version under the router rip configuration mode.
```
router rip
  version 2
```
