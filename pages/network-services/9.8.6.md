NBAR protocol discovery is used for classifying traffic for accounting and performance management. NBAR inspects the IP packet's payload all the way up to Layer 7. We used it previously, for example, to identify http traffic. The extension for HTTP traffic dives deeper than just looking at well-known ports - in previous examples we even limited the classification by host name. Another useful feature Of NBAR is that you can define your own protocols. These protocol definitions are contained in a Packet Description Language Model (PDLM). There are widely available PDLMs (about 100), and new ones are constantly being added. Starting in IOS version12.3, Cisco introduced the ability to define customer protocols straight from IOS using the **ip nbar custom CUSTOM_PDLM \[parameters\]** command.

To enable NBAR protocol discovery on an interface, use the following command.
```
R1(config)# interface GigabitEthernet0/1
R1(config-if)# ip nbar protocol-discovery
R1(config-if)# end
```
Then to define a customer protocol, you must enter NBAR custom configuration mode.
```
R1(config)# ip nbar custom HTTP transport tcp id 1
R1(config-custom)# port 8080 8888
R1(config-custom)# direction source
R1(config-custom)# ip subnet 10.0.10.0 24
R1(config-custom)# end
```

You use **show ip nbar protocol-discovery** to view statistics via the CLI.
