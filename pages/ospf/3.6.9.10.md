Transit Capability is automatic in IOS. By default, if a virtual-link connects a non-backbone area to the backbone, and there exists better routes for certain prefixes using the non-backbone area as transit, then those LSAs will be flooded resulting in entries in the RIB for these routes. To prevent this behavior, you can disable transit capability.
```
R1(config)# router ospf 1
R1(config-router)# no capability transit
R1(config-router)# end
```
