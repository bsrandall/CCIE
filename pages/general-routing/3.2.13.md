ISATAP, when compared to Automatic 6to4 Tunneling, is used to transport packets *within* a site while 6to4 tunnels transport packets between isolated sites. As with 6to4 tunneling, the key to understanding how it operates lies in understanding the address formation. The Network ID can be an 64-bit prefix. 0000::5EFE:X:X is the 64-bit interface ID, where X:X is generated from the IPv4 tunnel source we are using on each router. This address is created automatically when we define the tunnel source and then set the tunnel mode to ISATAP. Unlike Automatic 6to4 Tunneling, the network administrator does not have to convert the Decimal IPv4 address to Hex, IOS does it automatically.

Unlike 6to4 tunneling, there is not the need to carefully map out IPv4 to IPv6 address mappings.

| 64 bits | 32 bits | 32 bits |
| link local or global IPv6 unicast prefix | 0000:5EFE | IPv4 address of the ISATAP link |

Above is the format of the ISATAP address. Below is a sample configuration of the ISATAP router.
```
RouterA:
configure terminal
!
interface Tunnel 0
ip address 2001:80f0:4:300::/64 eui-64
no ipv6 nd suppress-ra
tunnel source 172.16.1.20
tunnel mode ipv6ip isatap
```
The prefix assigned to the tunnel interface is the prefix that will be assigned to hosts. Notice the **no ipv6 nd suppress-ra** command is required to ensure that router advertisements are sent over the tunnel to hosts. By default, these messages are not used on tunnel interfaces.
