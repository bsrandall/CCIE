I believe this post topic is referring to Expanded Community Lists. In Doyle’s first edition, he referred to them as Extended Community Lists.

Standard community lists enable you to specify a single community, either by number or in the AA:NN format, per line. Standard community lists can be either numbered (1–99) or named, with the keyword standard preceding the name.

Expanded community lists use regular expressions to give you more flexibility in matching a set of communities in a single line. They are either numbered in the range 100–500 or named with the keyword expanded preceding the name.
<pre><code>R1(config)# ip community-list 200 permit .*:1*
R1(config)# route-map EXPANDED deny 10
R1(config-route-map)# match community 200
R1(config-route-map)# route-map EXPANDED permit 20
R1(config-route-map)# exit
R1(config)# router bgp 100
R1(config-router)# neighbor 10.10.10.10 route-map EXPANDED out
R1(config-router)# exit
</code></pre>
