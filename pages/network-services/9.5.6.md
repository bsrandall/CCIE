An alias means that the router "owns" the IP address and can terminate any connections to that IP, similar to what would happen if it were the IP of a directly connected interface. Let's look at an example.
```
R1(config)# ip nat inside source static 192.168.17.2 200.200.200.2
R1(config)# interface GigabitEthernet0/1
R1(config-if)# ip address 192.168.17.1 255.255.255.0
R1(config-if)# ip nat inside
R1(config-if)# interface GigabitEthernet0/2
R1(config-if)# ip address 200.200.200.1 255.255.255.0
R1(config-if)# ip nat outside
```
We can see in our example that interface GigabitEthernet0/2 has an IP address of 200.200.200.1, but our inside global address for the NAT is 200.200.200.2. With an IP Alias, it will terminate any connection to 200.200.200.2, similar to if it was the interface IP.

Now what about with no alias? With no alias, the router does not "own" the IP address. The router will still reply to an ARP request for the globally translated IP address, but it will drop traffic destined to that IP unless:
- it has a route to the device that owns the IP
- it has a NAT rule to translate the destination to a different IP that the router has a route to.
```
R1(config)# ip nat inside source static tcp 192.168.17.2 23 200.200.200.2 8023 extendable no-alias
```
Now, if we were to telnet to 200.200.200.2 from the inside NAT interface, traffic would be translated correctly to 200.200.200.2:8023 because there is a NAT translation rule that matches the traffic. However, if we were to ping 200.200.200.2, there would be no response, because the router does not have a NAT translation for ICMP and there is an explicit **no-alias** command used in teh NAT rule.
