A Cisco device can be set up as a TFTP server. You specify the system image to send in response to read requests. Multiple files can be designated and you can optionally establish an alias for each file as well as a standard access list giving access to only certain clients.
```
R1(config)# tftp-server flash0:config alias conf 11
```
Here 11 would be a standard numbered access list permitting access from certain hosts.

As we have seen with other clients, you can specify the source interface to be used for the TFTP client.
```
R2(config)# ip tftp source-interface Loopback0
```
