When summarization is configured in OSPF, similar to EIGRP and BGP, a matching route to Null0 for the summary is installed locally in the routing table. This “discard” route is used to prevent the forwarding of traffic toward a shorter match, such as a default route, if no specific route toward the actual destination exists in the network.

The automatic origination of the discard route can be disabled with the **no discard-route [internal | external]**, where internal refers to inter-area summarization performed with the area range command, and external refers to redistributed summarization performed with the summary-address command.

You would disable the discard route in situations where you want the traffic to flow to other possible destinations, such as a default route, if there is no match via the local router.
