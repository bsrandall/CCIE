Standard access lists only allow you to match on source IP address. They are most frequently used to block traffic close to the destination. Traffic filtering using standard ACLs is pretty straightforward. The hardest part is calculating the wildcard mask. It will take some practice to get good at the crazy, stupid ones such as "allow access  from router R2 through R6 if they have an even third octet".

For example, assume you needed to filter 150.1.Y.0/24 to allow only even routers 1 through 6 (2, 4, and 6). We know right away that we have a wildcard mask that looks something like 0.0.Y.255, but how do we determine Y?

Since Y only varies from 1 to 6, only the last 3 bits of the third octet may change:

0.0.00000XXX.255

Next, we write down all possible values that Y can be:

00000010
00000100
00000110

Next, we need to find the "bit-vector" that changes between different values. We need to examine which bits actually change to represent the 3 values we need to match. It is easy to see above that bits 1 and 2 are the only ones that change. So, our mask vector is:

00000110

Next, note that you may need to explicitly deny the extra values covered by the mask vector. So in our example, if there were a router at 150.1.8.0/24, we would need an explicit deny for that router:
```
R1(config)# ip access-list extended NO_EIGHT
R1(config-ext-nacl)# 10 deny ip host 150.1.8.1 any
```

To come up with the final base third octet, that is 150.1.Y.0 , do an AND on all values:

00000010
00000100
00000110
--------
00000000

The resulting permit ACL would be:
```
R1(config)# access-list 10 permit 150.1.0.0 0.0.6.255
```

Here is another example. On this one, we want to match IP addresses in subnets 150.1.Y.0/24 where Y is an odd number between 1 and 6, inclusive. Again, we know the mask will look like 0.0.Y.255. What will Y be? Like before, we need to look at what the possible values are for the third octet:

00000001
00000011
00000101

So the mask vector would be 00000110.

To come up with the final base third octet, we perform our AND operation on all the matching values:

00000001
00000011
00000101
--------
00000001

The resulting permit ACL would be:
```
R1(config)# access-list 11 permit 150.1.1.0 0.0.6.255
```
We would need to explicitly deny 150.1.7.0.
