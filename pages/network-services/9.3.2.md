A quick review of the DHCP process:
DHCPDISCOVER (broadcast) ------> <br />
<----------- DHCPOFFER (unicast) <br />
DHCPREQUEST (broadcast)--------> <br />
<------------- DHCPACK (unicast) <br />

To configure a router interface to act as a DHCP client, you first enable any client options and then use the **ip address dhcp** command to acquire an IPv4 address on an interface from DHCP.
```
R1(config)# interface GigabitEthernet0/1
R1(config-if)# ip dhcp client client-id ascii MYID
R1(config-if)# ip dhcp client lease 0 12 0
R1(config-if)# ip dhcp client hostname CLIENT1
R1(config-if)# ip address dhcp
R1(config-if)# end
```

If you ever need to perform a release/renew, it is straightforward.
```
R1# release dhcp GigabitEthernet0/1
R1# renew dhcp GigabitEthernet0/1
```
