Top Talkers is a Netflow feature that allows the top flows to be sorted for easier monitoring, troubleshooting, and retrieval at the CLI level. Top talkers can be sorted in this manner:
- total number of packets in each top talker
- total number of bytes in each top talker
You can also use the **match** command to filter top talkers based on specific criteria such as source/destination IP address, application port, etc.

Top talkers only includes active, non-expired flows, so you may miss short and bursty transmissions. Here is an example of entering top talker configuration mode and viewing the optional first level commands.
```
R1(config)# ip flow-top-talkers
R1(config-flow-top-talkers)#?
Netflow top talker configuration commands:
  cache-timeout  Configure cache timeout
  default        Set a command to its defaults
  exit           Exit from top talkers configuration mode
  match          Configure match criteria
  no             Negate a command or set its defaults
  sort-by        Configure top talker sort criteria
  top            Configure number of top talkers
```
Here is a full configuration.
```
R1(config)# ip flow-top-talkers
R1(config-flow-top-talkers)# top 10
R1(config-flow-top-talkers)# sort-by bytes
R1(config-flow-top-talkers)# match source address 155.1.0.0 255.255.255.0
R1(config-flow-top-talkers)# match protocol 1
R1(config-flow-top-talkers)# end
```
