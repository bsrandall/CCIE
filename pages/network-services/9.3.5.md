The Cisco IOS DHCP server on-dmeand address pool (ODAP) manager is used to centralize the management of large pools of addresses. When a Cisco IOS router is configured as an ODAP manager, pools of addresses are dynamically increased or decreased in size depending on the address utilization level.
```
R1(config)# ip dhcp pool INE
R1(dhcp-config)# network 192.168.17.0/24
R1(dhcp-config)# origin dhcp subnet size initial /24 autogrow /24
R1(dhcp-config)# utilization mark low 20
R1(dhcp-config)# utilization mark high 80
R1(dhcp-config)# end
```
I probably need to find a video on this or study it some more. The Cisco documentation is not clear on practical uses.
