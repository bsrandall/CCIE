BGP uses TCP Port 179 as its underlying delivery mechanism. This allows the TCP layer to handle the basics of acknowledgement, retransmission, and sequencing. TCP also handles the MD5 authentication. You can see, BGP is simply a TCP application.

BGP is a **path vector** routing protocol. It uses this path to ensure a loop free environment (for eBGP). If a router receives an advertisement with its own AS in the path, it discards the update. Since routers within the same iBGP domain have the same AS, there is no loop protection mechanism inherent to the protocol. That is the reason why BGP advertisements are not learned from one neighbor by a router and then passed to another neighbor by the router that just learned it. And that is the reason a full mesh (or route reflector) is required for iBGP Peers.

BGP is considered a WAN protocol because it is not concerned with the details of the topologies within each AS. It can be said that BGP takes a higher view of the entire internetwork than an IGP does. Because this view is not compatible with the view seen by an IGP, Cisco IOS maintains a separate RIB to hold BGP routes. The command **show ip bgp** shows the BGP RIB table.

When there are parallel, equal-cost paths to a particular destination, the IOS implementation of BGP by default selects only one pathâ€”in contrast to other IP routing protocols, in which the default is to load balance across up to four paths. As with the other IP routing protocols, the maximum-paths command changes the default maximum number of parallel paths in the range from 1 to 16.

When two neighbors first establish a BGP peer connection, they exchange their entire BGP routing tables. After that, they exchange incremental, partial updates; that is, they exchange routing information only when something changes, and only information about what changed. Because BGP does not use periodic routing updates, the peers must exchange keepalive messages to ensure that the connection is maintained. The IOS default keepalive interval is 60 seconds (RFC 4271 does not specify a standard keepalive time); if three intervals (180 seconds) pass without a peer receiving a keepalive message, the peer declares its neighbor down. You can change these intervals with the **timers bgp** command.
