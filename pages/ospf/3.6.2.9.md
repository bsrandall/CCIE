With Broadcast and Non-Broadcast Multi-access networks, the originator of the LSA is the next-hop. Sam thing with Point-to-point, though there really is no alternative.

With Point-to-MultiPoint and Point-to-MultiPoint Non-Broadcast, the next-hops of routes are changed to the IP address of then neighbor interface that sent the LSA, regardless of what router originated the LSA. This is because OSPF can only exchange information between routers if there is a direct Layer 2 connection.
