LSA and redistributed prefix limiting in OSPF is used to prevent attacks or misconfigurations in the OSPF domain, which could interrupt normal forwarding, such as if the full Internet BGP table were accidentally redistributed into IGP.

Limit maximum number of LSAs in the database:
```
R1(config)# router ospf 1
R1(config-router)#max-lsa <1-4294967294>
R1(config-router)# exit
```

Limit maximum number of redistributed routes:
```
R1(config)# router ospf 1
R1(config-router)#redistribute maximum-prefix <1-4294967294>
R1(config-router)# exit
```

To specify the minimum percentage of CPU process time OSPF takes before the CPU should yield to a process with a higher priority:
```
R1(config)# router ospf 1
R1(config-router)#process-min-time percent <1-100>
R1(config-router)# exit
```
