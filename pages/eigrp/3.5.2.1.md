### Overview
The feasibility condition states that the reported distance of a route must be lower than the feasible distance of the current successor route. To really understand this, though, you must have a good grasp on the somewhat confusing terminology that EIGRP uses.

EIGRP routers know only of routes advertised by directly adjacent neighbors. One of the advanced features of EIGRP is its ability to store backup routes when certain condition are met. This shortens the time for convergence when the primary route goes down. These backup routes are known as **feasible successors**.  These routes are not used in the forwarding of traffic, but can be injected into the routing table immediately in place of a failed **successor** route.

An EIGRP router advertises each destination it can reach with an attached metric that in EIGRP terms is called the **reported distance**.

### Definitions

#### TERMS THAT DESCRIBE ROUTES

**Successor** - *the current best EIGRP route for a particular destination that is actively forwarding traffic (installed in the routing table)*

**Feasible Successor** -* a backup route that is stored in the EIGRP topology table that can immediately replace a **Successor** route should it fail. A feasible successor is a path whose reported distance is less than the feasible distance.*

#### TERMS THAT DESCRIBE COST

**Reported Distance** - *the metric a neighbor router is advertising for a particular route.*

**Feasible Distance** - *the best metric along a path to a destination network, including the metric to the neighbor reporting that path (including the neighbor's reported distance)*

**Feasibility Condition** - *a route will not be accepted as a feasible successor if the route’s Reported Distance is more than the BEST path’s Feasible Distance*
