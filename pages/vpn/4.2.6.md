Group Encrypted Transport (GET) VPN is a technology use dto encrypt traffic going through unsecured networks. It leverages the IPsec protocol suite to enforce the integ- rity and confidentiality of data. Typical GET deployment consists of a router called Key Server (KS) and a couple of routers called Group Members (GM). The KS is used to cre- ate, maintain, and send a “policy” to GMs. The policy provides information as to what traffic should be encrypted by the GM and what encryption algorithms must be used.

The Key Server generates two keys:
- Transport Encryption Key (TEK): used by the GM to encrypt the data
- Key Encryprion Key (KEK)- used to encrypt information between the KS and GM

A very important aspect of GET is that it does not set up any IPsec tunnels between GMs as DMVPN does. Every GM has the policy (what to encrypt, what encryption algorithm to use, and what key is used by the encryption algorithm) and just encrypts every packet that conforms to its specific policy and sends it to the network using ESP (Encapsulated Security Payload). Note that it uses original IP addresses to route the packet out (this is called the IP Header Preservation mechanism); hence the packet can be routed toward every other router in the network as long as the routing table has such information.

Here is a simple configuration showing a KS and a GM.

The server address registers R4 and R5 as a GM to the Key Server. The Key Server does not participate in user traffic encryption and only distributes keying information and encryption policies.
