In recent IOS versions, the FTP server has been completely removed. The server shipped on prior versions had numerous security flaws, and rather than fix them, Cisco decided to remove the FTP server capability from its devices. For file transfer, TFTP and HTTP will be the go-forward choices.

There are a few options for configuring the client:
```
R1(config)#ip ftp ?
  passive           Connect using passive mode
  password          Specify password for FTP connections
  source-interface  Specify interface for source address in FTP connections
  username          Specify username for FTP connections

R1(config)#
```
