We saw in a previous post that a dual-rate, three-color policer uses CIR and PIR as the two rates. The idea is to set a Commited rate, and packets arriving below the CIR are conforming to the contract. You also define the PIR. Packets arriving above the CIR but below the PIR are exceeding the contract. Finally, those packets arriving above the PIR are considered to violate the contract. We can look at a sample configuration.
```
R1(config)# policy-map POLICER
R1(config-pmap)# class class-default
R1(config-pmap-c)# police CIR 64000 PIR 128000 conform-action transmit exceed-action transmit violate-action drop
R1(config-pmap-c)# exit
R1(config-pmap)# exit
R1(config)# interface GigabitEthernet0/1
R1(config-if)# service-policy out POLICER
R1(config-if)# end
```
