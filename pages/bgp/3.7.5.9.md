At the bottom of the BGP path selection process is to prefer the path advertised by the peer with the lowest Router ID. This is pretty straightforward. Just remember that changing a routerâ€™s BGP Router ID will hard-reset all active BGP sessions.
```
R1(config)# router bgp 64512
R1(config-router)# bgp router-id 1.1.1.1
R1(config-router)# exit
```
