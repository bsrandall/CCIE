There are two features to this topic. First is the interface configuration command **authorized arp**. When enabled, it disables dynamic learning of MAC addresses to IP mappings on that interface. Additionally, the Authorized ARP feature sends periodic ARP messages on a per-minute basis to determine if a host is still connected to the network.

The next component is the DHCP pool configuration subcommand **update arp**. This feature secures ARP table entries to the corresponding DHCP leases. Existing active DHCP leases will not be secured until the lease is renewed after applying this command.
```
R1(config)# ip dhcp pool VLAN146
R1(dhcp-config)# update arp
R1(dhcp-config)# exit
R1(config)# interface GigabitEthernet0/1
R1(config-if)# arp authorize
R1(config-if)# exit
R1(config)# arp 155.1.146.4 0050.568d.4949 arpa
R1(config)# end
```
Notice the static mapping at the end. If a static address is assigned to any host on the network, you must use a static ARP mapping as it will not be dynamically learned due to **authorize arp** being enabled.
