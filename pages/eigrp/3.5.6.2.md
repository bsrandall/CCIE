Prefix Lists are a great way to filter routes when you need to filter based on prefix length. Below would be an example.
```
R1(config)# ip prefix-list PRE-1 seq 5 permit 172.16.1.0/24 le 24
R1(config)# router eigrp 100
R1(config-router)# distribute-list prefix PRE-1 gig0/0 in
R1(config-router)# end
```
Based on the above configuration, if an advertised route of 172.16.1.8/27 were advertised to the gig0/0 interface, that route would be ignored because the prefix length is not 24.

Prefix lists can be used with either distribute lists or route maps. Prefix lists cannot be used with offset lists.

Donâ€™t forget that with the distribute-list, you can define which routes to filter and from what routers (gateways) to receive or reject routes from. The below configuration is from an INE lab where we wanted to deny all routes coming from a particular router interface.
```
R1(config)# ip prefix-list NO-R4 seq 5 deny 155.1.146.4/32
R1(config)# ip prefix-list NO-R4 seq 10 permit 0.0.0.0/0 le 32
R1(config)# ip prefix-list PERMIT-ALL seq 5 permit 0.0.0.0/0 le 32
R1(config)# router eigrp 100
R1(config-router)# distribute-list prefix PERMIT-ALL gateway NO-R4 in
```
The above will not allow any routes sourced from 155.1.146.4, but will permit all other routes learned from any other source.
