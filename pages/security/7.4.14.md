IP Source Tracker is a security feature of IOS software that helps identify the source of origin of a DoS attack. IP Source Tracker gathers flow statistics for specific destination (victim) IPs that you specify, and will periodically export these flows without overloading the router.

For example, let's assume you have a server at 65.45.2.27 that is undergoing a DoS attack. You could enable IP Source Tracker with:
```
R1(config)# ip source-track 65.45.2.27
```
Then, if you wanted to send to Syslog you coul use this command:
```
R1(config)# ip source-track syslog-interval 2
```
You can also configure how often to export the information:
```
R1(config)# ip source-track export-interval 60
```

Using the information exported, you should be able to determin from which interface the DoS attack traffic is sourced. You would then go to the next upstream router and enable IP SOurce Tracker (if needed) until you got to the ISP who had the offending customer.

Here is an example **show ip source-track** - you can see how it indicates the destination IP address, source interface, and traffic details.
```
R1# show ip source-track
Address         SrcIF    Bytes   Pkts   Bytes/s   Pkts/s
10.0.0.1        PO0/0    119G   1194M    513009     5127
192.168.1.1     PO0/0    119G   1194M    513009     5127
```
