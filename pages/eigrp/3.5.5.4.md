We saw leak maps previously with summarization. The leak map allowed us to advertise component routes in addition to the summary. Leak maps can have a similar effect with Stub Routers. Normally when you declare a router as a Stub, it hides all other networks from the Stub’s upstream neighbors. By definition, the Stub should not be used to as a transit path to reach another network.

But what if….? I guess there is always an exception. Leak maps allow us to expose networks that might lie behind an EIGRP router we have declared a stub. The configuration is identical to when we used leak maps with summarization.
1. identify the routes to be leaked via a prefix list or access lists
2. match the prefix list / access list via a route map
3. in the stub definition, call the route map with the **leak-map** option

```
R1(config)# ip access-list 1 permit 5.5.0.0 0.0.0.255
R1(config)# route-map LEAK permit 10
R1(config-route-map)# match ip address 1
R1(config)# router eigrp 100
R1(config-router)# eigrp stub connected leak-map LEAK
```
