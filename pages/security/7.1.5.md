We saw in the previous post an example of using a VACL to filter IP traffic from entering a VLAN. We can also use a VACL to filter Layer 2 traffic.

```
SW1(config)# mac access-list extended MAC
SW1(config-ext-macl)# permit host 000.000.011 any
SW1(config-ext-macl)# exit
SW1(config)# vlan access-map BASIC_MAC_ACL 10
SW1(config-access-map)# match ip address MAC
SW1(config-access-map)# action forward vlan 10
SW1(config-access-map)# vlan access-map BASIC_MAC_ACL 20
SW1(config-access-map)# action forward
SW1(config-access-map)# exit
SW1(config)# vlan filter BASIC_MAC_ACL vlan-list 2-9
```

Notice the sequence 20 of our acess map - for this example that would mean that all other traffic that is not from host 000.000.011 is forwarded normally.
