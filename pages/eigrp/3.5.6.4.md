With an IGP, an extended access list can be used to filter routes. When using in this manner, the typical “source” field of the access list is the routing source sending the updates, and the “destination” is the actual routes being filtered.
```
R1(config)# ip access-list extended ACL-E seq 10 permit ip host 10.10.10.1 192.168.17.0 0.0.0.255
R1(config-router)# router eigrp 100
R1(config-router)# distribute-list ACL-E gig0/0 in
R1(config-router)# end
```
The extended access list above would only allow inbound routes to be learned from EIGRP neighbor 10.10.10.1 for the 192.168.17.0/24 network.

Note that the extended ACL will have a different meaning for BGP route filtering.
