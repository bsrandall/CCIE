The leak map allows you to advertise a specific prefix within the range of a summary advertisement, as well as the summary itself.To configure the EIGRP leak map, there are 3 steps.
1. Create an ACL or Prefix List to match the routes you want to leak.
2. Create a Route Map and call the ACL into it.
3. Map the Route Map with **ip summary-address eigrp** with the *leak* keyword

Here is a sample configuration in named mode.
```
R1(config)# ip prefix-list LEAK60 seq 10 permit 6.0.0.0/24
R1(config)# route-map LEAK-PF60 permit 10
R1(config-route-map)# match ip address prefix-list LEAK60
R1(config-route-map)# exit
R1(config)# router eigrp MULTI-AF
R1(config-router)# address-family ipv4 unicast autonomous-system 100
R1(config-router-af)# af-interface GigabitEthernet0/1
R1(config-router-af-interface)# summary-address 0.0.0.0/0 leak-map LEAK-PF60
```
You could take this as far as advertising all routes in addition to a default route summary. You can also use it to announce a default but force the path one direction by leaking a more specific route. Because of the longest match rule, traffic will flow towards the leak.
