NAT Overload is the same thing as Port Address Translation (PAT). We saw an example in our previous post. It uses the same inside global IP address for all outbound translations, only changing port numbers to uniquely identify sessions. With any other form of NAT if an existing translation to an outside local address exists, a new mapping will not be created until the existing one is cleared.
```
R1(config)# access-list 10 permit 155.1.146.0 0.0.0.255
R1(config)# ip nat inside source list 10 interface GigabitEthernet0/1.13 overload
R1(config)# interface GigabitEthernet0/1.146
R1(config-if)# ip nat inside
R1(config-if)# interface GigabiteEthernet0/1.13
R1(config-if)# ip nat outside
R1(config-if)# end
```
As we pointed out earlier, the **overload** keyword is what makes this PAT in IOS.
