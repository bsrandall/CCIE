Backup Interface is a Cisco feature that can be used in place of floating static routes for interface based failover.

```
interface Serial0/0/0
  backup interface Serial0/0/1
  backup delay 10 30
```
In the example above interface Serial0/0/1 is the backup for interface Serial0/0/0. If Serial0/0/0 is down for 10 seconds, then Serial0/0/1 will take over as the primary interface. After Serial 0/0/0 has been up for 30 seconds, it will resume its role as the primary interface.

On SFP Ports, you can optionally make the electrical interface the backup to the fiber interface. Below is a sample configuration.
```
R1(config)# interface GigabitEthernet0/1
R1(config-if)# media-type sfp auto-failover
```

If no media type is specified on a combo port, then whichever is linked up first becomes active. To disable this behavior, you must specify the media type as above (with or without the auto-failover).
