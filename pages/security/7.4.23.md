The IPv6 PACL feature provides the ability to provide access control on Layer 2 switch ports for IPv6 traffic. They are supported only in the ingress direction and only in hardware.
```
R1(config)# interface GigabitEthernet0/1
R1(config-if)# access-group mode prefer port
R1(config-if)# ipv6 traffic-filter DENY_THESE in
```
