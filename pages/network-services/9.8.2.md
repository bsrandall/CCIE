ICMP Router Discovery Protocol (IRDP) allows hosts to locate routers that can be used as a gateway to reach other networks. An IRDP advertising router uses ICMP messages to advertise itself or other routers as a candidate default gateway on a segment. Multiple routers can advertise themselves at the same time, with different priorities. Hosts are then configured to listen for IRDP messages and use the preferred host. IRDP is an interface level command. Higher priority is better.
```
R1(config-if)# ip irdp ?
  address            addresses to proxy-advertise
  holdtime           how long a receiver should believe the information
  maxadvertinterval  maximum time between advertisements
  minadvertinterval  minimum time between advertisements
  multicast          advertisements are sent with multicasts
  preference         preference level for this interface
  \<cr\>
```
Here would be a sample configuration.
```
R1(config)# interface GigabitEthernet0/1
R1(config-if)# ip irdp
R1(config-if)# ip irdp address 192.168.17.254 1000
R1(config-if)# ip irdp maxadvertinterval 20
R1(config-if)# ip irdp minadvertinterval
R1(config-if)# end
```

IRDP was never widely deployed probably due to the fact that it required client drivers to be installed. Bacuase of the differing priorities, it can be used as a FHRP.
