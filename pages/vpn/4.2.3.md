Static Crypto Maps are a basic way to set up an On-demand IPSec tunnel. Matching traffic triggers an ISAKMP session to start. This matching traffic is marked as "interesting" by a Proxy ID that is defined by ACLs. One benefit is it allows for very granular control over what traffic travels over the IPsec tunnel.


There is a default configuration for Phase 1 and Phase 2 which will be used if no policies are defined. When configuraing from scratch, it is a 5 step configuration process. First, we define the Phase 1 ISAKMP policy - we have seen this previously.
```
```
R1(config)# crypto isakmp policy 1
R1(config-isakmp)# encryption aes
R1(config-isakmp)# hash md5
R1(config-isakmp)# group2
R1(config-isakmp)# lifetime 190
R1(config-isakmp)# authentication pre-share
R1(config-isakmp)# crypto isakmp key KEY address 10.102.0.2
```

The peers must agree on Authentication, Encryption, Hash, and DH group or Phase 1 will fail.


We then jump to Phase 2. Here we define the Who, What, and How.
- Who: define peer address
- What: define Proxy ACL
- How: define Transform Set


We create a *crypto map* called EXAMPLE_MAP, with sequence number 1 - this will answer the Phase 2 questions from above. A crypto map can be a collection of entries, each with a different sequence number, though we'll just use one entry. The **ipsec-isakmp** argument tells the router that this map is an IPsec map. We tell the router about its peer (10.102.0.2) yet again and we set the security-association (SA) lifetime.
```
R1(config)# crypto map EXAMPLE_MAP 1 ipsec-isakmp
R1(config-crypto-map)# set peer 10.102.0.2
R1(config-crypto-map)# set security-association lifetime seconds 190
R1(config-crypto-map)# set transform-set EXAMPLE
R1(config-crypto-map)# match address 101
```
The Crypto Map points to our EXAMPLE transform set below. It also refernces access-list 101, which specifies the traffic being configured. Oops, now I guess you know what step 4 is!

The third step is to configure that ACL.
```
R1(config)# access-list 101 permit ip any any
```

Next, we create an IPsec transform set that we will call EXAMPLE. We specify the authentication protocol for the IPsec Authentication Header (AH) and we specify the encryption protocol for the IPsec Encapsulating Security Payload (ESP). These don't have to be the same proocols that IKE uses. In fact, we'll use SHA for authentication and AES-256 for encryption.
```
R1(config)# crypto ipsec transform-set EXAMPLE ah-sha-hmac esp-aes 256
```

Finally, in the 5th step we apply the Crypto Map to an interface or subinterface. We can only apply 1 crypto map per interface. One crypto map can however be applied to multiple interfaces. The Crypto Map is always outbound with respect to traffic direction.

It is important to remember the order of operations when it comes to Crypto Maps. Encryption applies after routing and after NAT policies have been applied.


Always remember that the peers must have underlying Layer 3 reachability. Synamic routing (IGPs) are not supported inside a Crypto Map - you would need to switch to Tunnels for that support. The reason behind this is the Crypto Map has no interface which routes can be associated with.

This is considered a legacy design, but it remains prevalent because there are so many in service configurations.
