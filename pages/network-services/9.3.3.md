We have seen this in several topics but here we will introduce DHCP Relay formally. A DHCP relay agent is any host that forwards DHCP packets between clients and servers. A DHCP Relay agent is required when the clients and server are not on the same network. The relay agent sets the gateway IP address (giaddr) and if configured, add the relay agent information option to the packet before forwarding toward the server.

DHCP clients typically broadcast UDP DHCPDISCOVER messages when they need to request an IP address. Routers will not normally forward such requests as it is broadcast traffic. An IOS router configured with an **ip helper-address** will act as a relay and forward these DHCPDISCOVER broadcasts towars the DHCP server. The configuration is pretty simple.
```
R1(config)# interface GigabitEthernet0/1
R1(config-if)# ip helper-address 155.1.23.2
```
If you want the information option (option 82) to appear in BOOTREQUEST messages forwarded to a DHCP server, you would need this line as well.
```
R1(config)# ip dhcp relay information option
```
You can also perform this at the interface level:
```
R1(config-if)# ip dhcp relay information option-insert
```

We also will see this in more detail later on the post regarding Option 82, but you can add a unique identifier to the subscriber identifier suboption of the relay agent information option.
```
R1(config)# ip dhcp relay information option
R1(config)# interface GigabitEthernet0/1
R1(config-if)# ip dhcp relay information option subscriber-id gigabitethernet0-1
R1(config-if)# exit
```
