Internal Summarization can only occur between areas in OSPF. Therefore, we can only configure summarization on ABRs. An ABR, therefore, can change its connected router's view of its own area by summarizing the subnets into one entry. By default, this is not the case.

For example, if an ABR is attached to area 3 (and of course area 0), and in area 3 it has the subnet 155.1.8.0/24 and 155.1.10.0/24, then the ABR will send both networks as individual subnets into the backbone area via Type 3 Summary LSAs. But, if we use internal summarization, the ABR has the potential in this situation to only share one connected subnet, 155.1.8.0/22. We do this by using the **area range network netmask** ospf router command. The command will summarize the two Type 3 LSAs into one Type 3 Summary LSA.
```
R1(config)# router ospf 1
R1(config-router)# area 1 range 155.1.8.0 255.255.255.252
R1(config-router)# exit
```

Type 3 Summary LSAs are not flooded across areas.
