BGP relies upon TCP for its MD5 authentication. This makes authentication pretty straightforward.
```
`R1(config)# router bgp 100
R1(config-router)# neighbor 198.14.27.2 remote-as 200
R1(config-router)# neighbor 198.14.27.2 password CISCO
R1(config-router)# exit
```
`
The two troubleshooting messages are also straightforward. “No MD5 Digest” indicates that one peer does not have a password defined while the other does. “Invalid MD5 Digest” informs us that the peer password does not match.

It is best practice for each eBGP peer to have a different password.
