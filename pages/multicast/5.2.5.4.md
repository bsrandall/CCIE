Usually multiple candidate RPs are set up on a network with the intention of either load balancing or redundancy, or both.

For load balancing, configure the group-mapping access-lists so that every RP services a range of groups.

For redundancy, make both RPs service the same group ranges.The one with the highest IP will be selected by the Mapping Agent, but the other is still available for failover.
