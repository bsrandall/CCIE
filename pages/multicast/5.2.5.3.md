Auto-RP listener is a solution designed to allow using Auto-RP without risking any groups falling back to dense mode forwarding. This feature works in tandem with PIM sparse mode enabled on all interfaces (not PIM SM/DM). However, two Auto-RP multicast groups 224.0.1.39 and 224.0.1.40 are flooded in dense mode. No other groups are allowed to use dense mode and thus dangerous flooding fallback is eliminated. Its configuration is straighforward.
```
R1(config)# ip pim autorp listener
R1(config)# exit
```
