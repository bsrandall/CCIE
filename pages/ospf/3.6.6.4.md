As we mentioned in the last post, the ABR(s) of an NSSA do not automatically originate a default route. A default route can be originated as a Type-7 NSSA External LSA into the NSSA (by the ABR) by adding the **default-information-originate** option into the **area 3 nssa** statement. The cost that the ABR advertises for the default route can be modified with the **area 3 default-cost** command. The default route is injected by the ABR as a regular Type-7 LSA type N2 which uses the metric advertised by the ABR and the forwarding metric as the cost towards the ABR.
```
R1(config)# router ospf 1
R1(config-router)# area 3 nssa default-information-originate
R1(config-router)# are 3 default-cost 500
R1(config-router)# exit
```
