Both payload and compression tools require CPU cycles and memory, so the benefit must be measured to ensure it is worth the resource cost. Generally, serialization and queuing delays decrease when proper compression is implemented, because the packets are now smaller. Cisco also manufactures special hardware compression cards, that can offload the workload from the main CPU and memory. Once installed, no special configuration is required as IOS assumes you want to offload compression to the hadrware cards.

There are two compression techniques supported on serial links on Cisco routers. *Stacker* provides the best compression, particularly in the case of varying data, but at the cost of more CPU usage. *Predictor* attempts to predict the next bits to be transmitted based on history. It does not compress as well as *Stacker*, but it uses less CPU.
```
R1(config)# interface Serial0/0
R1(config-if)# compress stac
R1(config-if)# exit
R1(config)# interface Serial0/1
R1(config-if)# compress predictor
R1(config-if)# end
```
