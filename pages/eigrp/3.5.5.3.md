We learned in the previous topic that Query Scope is the distance from the originating router that an EIGRP Query will travel. Limiting Query Scope is a good thing as you do not want Queries to cascade throughout the network without need.

Using the Stub Router feature is one way of limiting Query Scope. By declaring a router as a Stub Router, you limit Query Scope as the neighbor routers will not send a Query to the Stub as it knows there are no hidden networks behind a Stub, as the definition of a Stub prevents that path from acting as a transit path to other networks.

A remote router is configured as a stub in router eigrp configuration mode.
```
R1(config)# router eigrp 100
R1(config-router)# eigrp stub
```
If none of the keywords are used (connected, static, leak-map, receive-only, redistributed, summary), then connected and summary routes are automatically advertised.

The receive-only keyword configures the router to only receive routes. It cannot be used in conjunction with any of the other EIGRP stub keywords.
