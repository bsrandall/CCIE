You can use NBAR to apply application based filters such as blocking youtube.com traffic. To accomplish this we can categorize traffic based on the HTTP hostname in a calss-map, and then apply a policy-map to drop the matching traffic. Finally, you would use the **service-policy** command to apply the policy to an interface.
```
R1(config)# class-map match-all YOUTUBE
R1(config-cmap)# match protocol http host "\*youtube.com\*"
R1(config-cmap)# exit
R1(config)# policy-map DROP_YOUTUBE
R1(config-pmap)# class YOUTUBE
R1(config-pmap-c)# drop
R1(config-pmap-c)# exit
R1(config)# interface GigabitEthernet0/0
R1(config-if)# service-policy output DROP_YOUTUBE
R1(config-if)# exit
```

Some things to remember about NBAR. If you need to change the default TCP/UDP application ports to something non-standard, use the following:
```
R1(config)# ip nbar port-map http tcp 81
```

The NBAR engine classifies bi-directional traffic flows. That is, if you apply a policy map matching the URL pattern inbound on an interface, the policy map will classify both incoming HTTP requests as well as packets returning in server replies. NBAR classification occurs independently of policy-map direction.

All matching with NBAR is case insensitive. If you are matching HTTP, make sure you use the **host** keyword if matching on FQDN - the heder NBAR uses has the FQDN separate from the file / directory path.

\* matches any sequence of characters
? matches any single character (you need to enter Control-V to enter ? or else you get help)
\| OR
\[\] matches range such as \[ab\] matches a or b
