Hackers who initiate Denial of Service attacks commonly send large streams of packets with IP options. Cisco routers cannot handle IP option in hardware - the packets are punted to the route processor to be handled in software. By dropping the packets with IP options, you can reduce the load of IP options packets on the router. The end result is a reduction in the effects of the DoS attack on the router and downstream routers.

The ACL IP Options Selective Drop feature allows Cisco routers to filter packets containing IP options, thereby mitigating the effects of these packets on a router and downstream router by performing the folling actions.
1. Drop all IP options packets it receives and prevent options from going deeper into the network
2. Ignore IP option packets destined for the router and treat them as if they had no IP options

If you want to drop all options packets that enter the network, perform the following:
```
R1(config)# ip options drop
```

This would be something you would implement during a suspected attack.
