EIGRP by default uses auto-summarization at classful network boundaries on a per router basis. What this means is that if a router is running multiple interfaces, and those interfaces are in separate classes, the EIGRP will, without any additional configuration, advertise a summary route toward each interface advertising the reachability of the classful destination out its attached interface. No wonder it can cause so many issues if left enabled!

The only exception to auto summarization is that external routes will not be automatically summarized.

In this example, R1 would summarize 1.0.0.0/8 and advertise it towards R2. R1 would also summarize 172.16.0.0/16 and advertise it towards R2.

You can see that discontiguous subnets are a real problem for auto-summarization.

EIGRP will create a summary route in its topology table pointing to Null0 and then install that route to its routing table with an AD of 5. This ensure that packets destined for a subnet in a summarized major network for which no route exists are properly discarded.
