There may be times when you need to leak a route from the global routing table to a VRF and from a VRF to the global routing table. For example, assume there is a NMS who sits in a VRF with an address of 10.0.2.2 that is reachable via PE4.

To access 10.0.2.0/30 from the global table, a static route to 10.0.2.0/30 that points out the VRF interface is introduced on PE4. This static route is then redistributed via IGP to al PE and P routers.

A static VRF route is also addres on PE4. The static VRF points to the subnet in the global network that sends the traffic to this NMS station. Without this addition, the PE-4 drops traffic, from the NMS station, that is received on the VRF interface.
```
R1(config)# ip vrf BLUE
R1(config-vrf)# rd 200:1
R1(config-vrf)# route-target both 200:1
R1(config-vrf)# exit
R1(config)# interface Serial 1/0
R1(config-if)# ip address 10.1.2.5 255.255.255.252
R1(config-if)# exit
R1(config)# interface Serial2/0
R1(config-if)# ip vrf forwarding BLUE
R1(config-if)# ip address 10.0.2.1 255.255.255.0
R1(config-if)# exit
R1(config)# ip route 10.0.2.0 255.255.255.252 Serial2/0
R1(config)# ip route vrf BLUE 10.1.2.4 255.255.255.252 Serial1/0
R1(config)# exit
```
This does, of course, introduce some security concerns. If you want to prevent the installation of static VRF routes to prevent this type of leaking, use the command **no ip route static inter-vrf** .

Route leaking between VRFs is usually a bit safer. The router automatically will not support static routes between VRFs. In order to achieve route leaking between VRFs, you must use the import functionality of the Route Target extended BGP community.
```
R1(config)# ip vrf BLUE
R1(config-vrf)# rd 100:1
R1(config-vrf)# route-target export 100:1
R1(config-vrf)# route-target import 100:1
R1(config-vrf)# route-target import 200:1
R1(config-vrf)# exit
R1(config)# ip vrf RED
R1(config-vrf)# rd 200:1
R1(config-vrf)# route-target export 200:1
R1(config-vrf)# route-target import 200:1
R1(config-vrf)# route-target import 100:1
```
