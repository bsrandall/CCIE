OSPF IPv4 remote loop-free alternate (LFA) IP fast reroute (IPFRR) uses a backup route, precomputed using the dynamic routing protocol, whenever a network fails. The backup routes (repair paths) are pre-computed and installed in the router as the backup for the primary paths. Once the router detects a link or adjacent node failure, it switches to the backup path to avoid traffic loss.

OSPF IPv4 remote LFA IPFRR allows the backup path to be more than one hop away. This feature is particularly useful in some topologies (such as the commonly used ring topology) where an LFA does not have to be directly connected to the protecting router.

The only supported tunneling method is MPLS.

```
R1(config)# router ospf 1
R1(config-router)# fast-reroute per-prefix remote-lfa area 2 tunnel mpls-ldp
```

This will be a good topic to review after learning MPLS.
