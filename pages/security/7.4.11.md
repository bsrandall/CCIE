TCP Intercept works to protect TCP servers from TCP SYN flooding attacks, which are a type of denial-of-service attack. A SYN flooding attack occurs when a hacker floods a server with a barrage of requests for connection. Because these messages have unreachable return addresses, the connections cannot be established, and the server becomes overwhelmed and can no longer service valid connection requests.

The TCP Intercept feature helps prevent SYN flooding attacks by intercepting and validating TCP connection requests. It works by intercepting TCP Synchronization packets from clients to servers that match a defined extended access list. The IOS software then established a connection to the requesting client on behalf of the destination server, and if successful, establishes a connection to the server on behalf of the client. It then knits the two connections together transparently.
