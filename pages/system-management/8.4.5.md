The EEM event timer can be used to respond to periodic or timed events. There are several different types of timers.
```
R1(config-applet)# event timer ?
  absolute	 Absolute timer event
  countdown  Countdown timer event
  cron       Cron timer event
  watchdog   Watchdog timer event
```
**absolute** specifies that an event is triggered when the specified absolute time of day occurs.

**countdown** specifies that an event is triggered when the specified time counts down to 0. The timer does not reset.

**cron** specifies that an event is triggered when the CRON string specification matches the current time. This is the UNIX CRON format of 0 0 1 * * for example. @yearly, @monthly, @weekly, @daily, @hourly can also be used.

**watchdog** specifies that an event is triggered when the specified time counts down to 0. The watchdog timer, unlike the countdown timer, does reset after reaching 0.

```
R1(config)# event manager applet SEND_RUNNING
R1(config-applet)# event timer watchdog time 300
R1(config-applet)# action 1.0 cli command "enable"
R1(config-applet)# action 2.0 cli command "write term"
R1(config-applet)# action 3.0 mail server "155.1.146.100" to "noc@INE.com" from "R1@INE.com" subject "Running Config" body $_cli_result
```

Notice how we use the $_cli_result to email our result.

As mentioned earlier, the **watchdog** timer will reset to its original value and begin another countdown after it recahes 0.
