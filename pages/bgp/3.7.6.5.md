We have seen before that classless routing always prefers a longer match. Some of the IGP protocols use leak maps as a way to advertise longer prefixes out of a stub or a summary to make traffic flow in a particular direction. A similar equivalent in BGP is the **unsuppress-map** neighbor option. It can be used when **agregate-address summary-only**  is configured as well. The prefixes describe din the **unsuppress-map** are advertised in addition to the aggregate summary.
```
R1(config)# ip prefix-list UNSUPPRESS_PREFIX seq 5 permit 150.1.4.4/24
R1(config)# route-map UNSUPPRESS_MAP permit 10
R1(config-route-map)#  match ip address prefix-list UNSUPPRESS_PREFIX
R1(config-route-map)# exit
R1(config)# router bgp 65535
R1(config-router)# aggregate-address 150.1.0.0 255.255.0.0 summary-only
R1(config-router)# neighbor 155.1.37.7 unsuppress-map UNSUPPRESS_MAP
R1(config-router)# exit
```
