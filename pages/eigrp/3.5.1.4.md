With the new EIGRP Named Configuration mode, you are able to configure multiple address families under one EIGRP process. You can even configure multiple processes within the same Address Family running different ASs. The configuration below shows this.
```
R1(config)# router eigrp TEST
R1(config-router)# address family ipv4 unicast autonomous-system 1
network 192.168.17.1 0.0.0.255
R1(config-router-af)#exit
R1(config-router)#  address family ipv6 unicast autonomous-system 1
R1(config-router-af)# network 2001::1/64
R1(config-router-af)# exit
```

Sometimes this is called Named mode but it is also called Multi-AF mode
