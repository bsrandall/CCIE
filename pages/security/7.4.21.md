The IPv6 First Hop ND Inspection feature is very similar to IPv4 Dynamic ARP Inspection. It is run on a switch in the segment to prevent host spoofing on the network. It works by inspecting DHCPv6 and NDP messages to create a neighbor binding table. You can also optionally enable basic RA Guard and DHCPv6 Guard through this feature. If you have devices on the network that have static addresses, you would need to manually define the IPv6 to MAC address binding. This feature can be applied at the VLAN or port level.

The configuration is straightforward. You first create a snooping policy and then you describe what you will be inspecting / snooping.
```
SW1(config)# ipv6 snooping policy HOSTS
SW1(config-ipv6-snooping)# security level inspect
SW1(config-ipv6-snooping)# drop-unsecure
SW1(config-ipv6-snooping)# device-role host
SW1(config-ipv6-snooping)# exit
SW1(config)# interface range GigabitEthernet0/2-22
SW1(config-if-range)# ipv6 nd inspection attach-policy HOSTS vlan 2-10
SW1(config-if-range)# end
```
