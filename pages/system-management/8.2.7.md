Access lists can be used not only to filter traffic, but also to classify packets for logging. For example, to log all EIGRP packets, you could use the following:
```
R1(config)# ip access-list extended LOGGING
R1(config-ext-nacl)# permit eigrp any any log
R1(config-ext-nacl)# permit ip any any
R1(config-ext-nacl)# exit
R1(config)# ip access-list logging interval 10000
R1(config)# ip access-list log-update threshold 2
R1(config)# interface GigabitEthernet0/1
R1(config-if)# ip access-group LOGGING in
R1(config-if)# end
```
Make sure you have a permit all statement at the end of your access list or else all traffic other than EIGRP would be denied. Also, always remember you need to apply the access list to an interface before it takes effect.

The **logging interval** specifies the minimum interval of log message generation, essentially providing a rate-limiting capability. The command allows only one packet per interval to be process switched no matter how many log-enabled ACEs exist! This is important as logged packets are process switched.

The **log-update threshold** command is used to configure how often syslog messages are generated and sent after the initial packet match. The argument given to the command is the number of messages. This is in contrast to the periodic updates, which is non-user configurable and set to every 5 minutes.
