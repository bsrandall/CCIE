OSPF network Type Loopback is a special case that is used for Loopback and looped-back interfaces. Similar to Point-to-Multipoint, an interface running network type Loopback is advertised as a Stub endpoint instead of a transit subnet. So when these devices are advertised into OSPF they appear as host routes to a /32 address.

You may want to override this default behavior if you need to advertise a loopback as a /24 or a /21 network. In order to do that, in interface configuration mode change the OSPF network type to Point-to-Point.
```
R1(config)# interface loopback0
R1(config-if)# ip address 10.10.10.1 255.255.255.0
R1(config-if)# ip ospf network point-to-point
R1(config-if)# exit
```
