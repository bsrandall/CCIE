In Named mode, configuring a router as a stub is done if Address Family mode. Below are the options:
```
R1(config-router-af)#eigrp stub ?
  connected      Do advertise connected routes
  leak-map       Allow dynamic prefixes based on the leak-map
  receive-only   Set receive only neighbor
  redistributed  Do advertise redistributed routes
  static         Do advertise static routes
  summary        Do advertise summary routes
  \<cr\>
R1(config-router-af)#exit
```
And here it is under the classic configuration mode.
```
R1(config)# ipv6 router eigrp 100
R1(config-rtr)# eigrp stub ?
  connected      Do advertise connected routes
  leak-map       Allow dynamic prefixes based on the leak-map
  receive-only   Set receive only neighbor
  redistributed  Do advertise redistributed routes
  static         Do advertise static routes
  summary        Do advertise summary routes
  \<cr\>
```
