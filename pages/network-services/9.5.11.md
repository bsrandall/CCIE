This is the manual method of defining the primary and backup SNAT pair. We saw previously that SNAT with HSRP uses the HSRP state of the router (active or standby) as its SNAT state. You can also set the SNAT role manually, as we see here.
```
R1(config)# ip nat stateful id 1
R1(config-ipnat-snat)# primary 10.0.0.1
R1(config-ipnat-snat)# peer 10.0.0.2
R1(config-ipnat-snat)# mapping-id 10
```
```
R2(config)# ip nat stateful id 2
R1(config-ipnat-snat)# backup 10.0.0.2
R1(config-ipnat-snat)# peer 10.0.0.1
R1(config-ipnat-snat)# mapping-id 10
```
Instead of allowing HSRP to do the tracking of primary and backup, it is accomplished by using a built-in SNAT keepalive.

Note - I could not find these configuration option on either VIRL or my AWS CSR 1000V router.
