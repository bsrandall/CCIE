We briefly touched on this with the previous topic. With CBWFQ, you can specify bandwidth reservation in kbps or with percentages. There are some rules to follow.
- when working with bandwidth percentages, it is set as a percentage of the configured **bandwidth** on the interface
- CBWFQ defaults to a **max-reserved-bandwidth** setting of 75% of the interface bandwidth, meaning a policy map cannot reserve more than 75% of the bandwidth specified on an interface. That is why it is not good to mix using kbps and bandwidth percent on the same policy map.
- class-default automatically gets 25% of the bandwidth

```
class-map match-all class4
  match ip dscp af21
 class-map match-all class3
  match ip dscp af33
class-map match-all class2
  match ip dscp af32
 class-map match-all class1
  match ip dscp af31
!
policy-map explicit-bw
  class class1
   bandwidth 64
  class class2
   bandwidth 32
!
policy-map percent-bw
  class class3
   bandwidth percent 25
  class class4
   bandwidth percent 25
!
```
