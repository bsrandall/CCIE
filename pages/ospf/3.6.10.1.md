Ciscoâ€™s implementation of OSPFv2 does not support Multicast OSPF, which is advertised through LSA Type-6. Upon receipt of this LSA type from a non-Cisco OSPF router, a log message is generated. To disable this, issue the **ignore lsa
mospf** command under the OSPF process.


A neighbor relationship cannot occur if two OSPF neighbors have different MTU values on their interfaces. If the MTU difference is by design, the interface-level command **ip ospf mtu-ignore** removes this requirement from the adjacency establishment. There really should be few practical reasons to ever need this command.

The **ip ospf name-lookup** command performs DNS resolution on the OSPF router-id value in show commands to simplify the identification of neighbors.
```
R10#show ip ospf neighbor
Neighbor ID     Pri   State           Dead Time   Address         Interface
R8                1   FULL/BDR        00:00:36    155.1.108.8     GigabitEthernet1.108
 ```
Usually you would see the Router ID in the Neighbor ID column above. Note that you must have DNS servers set up for this to work or have manual name to IP mappings in your config like this:
```
R1(config)# ip host R2 150.1.2.2
R1(config)# ip host R3 150.1.3.3
R1(config)# ip host R4 150.1.4.4
R1(config)# ip host R5 150.1.5.5
```
