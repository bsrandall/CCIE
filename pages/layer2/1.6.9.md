When using routed protocols, such as IPv4 or IPv6, we can go across VLAN boundaries by using IP routing between VLAN interfaces. However when using non-routed protocols such as IPX or Appletalk we do not have this capability. Fallback Bridging allows these non-routed protocols to communicate across VLAN boundaries.

Everything regarding fallback bridging is configured using bridge groups. These bridge groups are applied to SVIs and routed ports. Here is a sample configuration.
```
SW1(config)# bridge 1 protocol vlan-bridge
SW1(config)# interface vlan 200
SW1(config-if)# bridge-group 1
SW1(config-if)# exit
SW1(config)# interface vlan 300
SW1(config-if)# bridge-group 1
SW1(config-if)# exit
```
With the above configuration, the switch accepts connections from all MAC addresses learned from the two (or more) VLANs. You can disable this behavior like this:
```
SW1(config)# no bridge 1 acquire
```
You can then setup static assignments on whether you want to forward/deny specific MAC entries.
```
SW1(config)# bridge 1 address 000.1111.ab18 forward
```
