As with PVST+. path cost is by default derived from the media speed of an interface. MSTP uses cost when determine which port to block in cases where a loop may exist. To ensure that a particular port is chosen first, you may want to lower the cost value for that interface. The configuration is a bit different when dealing with MSTP.
```
SW1(config)# int GigabitEthernet0/1
SW1(config-if) spanning-tree mst 1 cost 1
SW1(config-if) end
```
