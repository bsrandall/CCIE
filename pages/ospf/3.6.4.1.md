Authentication in OSPF requires two steps. First you must enable authentication. This can be done either globally for all OSPF interfaces on the router, or by an interface by interface basis. Second, if using Type 1 or Type 2 authentication, you must then establish an authentication key on the desired interfaces.
```
R1(config)# router ospf 1
R1(config-router)# area 0 authentication
```
The above would enable authentication on all OSPF interfaces in area 0 from OSPF process 1. For MD5 the **message-digest** keyword is added.
```
```
R1(config)# router ospf 1
R1(config-router)# area 0 authentication message-digest
```
