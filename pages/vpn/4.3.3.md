We saw in [4.3.1](http://bscottrandall.com/4.3.1.html) the configuration for a DMVPN hub and spoke. Once configured, there are two phases to VPN establishment.
- Phase 1: persistent IPsec tunnels from all spokes to the Hub
- Phase 2: dynamic on-demand spoke-to-spoke IPsec tunnels established with DMVPN

#### Phase 1
The sequence of events for the first phase are as follows:
1. The spoke router (SPOKE-1-WEST) is connected to the backbone IP infrastructure and an IP address is assigned to the public interface.
2. The NHRP configuration on the spoke's tunnel interface attempts to establish a connection through the GRE tunnel to the hub. Note that the hub's IP address is preconfigured on the spoke. The mGRE tunnel interface encapsulates the NHRP client request with the hub as the destination.
3. IPSec configuration on the spoke triggers IKE from the spoke to the hub based on a GRE connection request from the spoke to the hub site (the hub's IKE identity is inferred from the GRE tunnel endpoints).
4. At the completion of the IKE and IPSec process, an IPSec protected GRE tunnel is established between the spoke and hub.
5. The spoke's NHRP client registration with the hub's NHRP server creates an entry in the hub's NHRP database for the mapping of the client's mGRE tunnel address to its dynamically assigned public IP address.
6. Routing protocol configuration on the spoke provides the reachability information for protected subnets behind the spoke to the hub.
7. The hub advertises reachability of a spoke's protected subnets to other spokes. Note that when a hub advertises the subnets from one spoke to the other, the next hop for these routes is not that hub, but rather is the spoke that originated these subnets.

#### Phase 2
With the completion of phase 1, all communication between the hub and spoke takes place over the persistent IPSec tunnels. Next, assume that a spoke has traffic destined for another spoke. DMVPN can dynamically build an IPSec tunnel between the spokes to achieve direct spoke-to-spoke communication as follows:
1. A host on the protected subnet of SPOKE-1-WEST needs to establish a connection to a host on the protected subnet of SPOKE-2-WEST. An IP packet is directed from HOST-1-WEST to HOST-2-WEST.
2. Phase 1 populated the routing table on SPOKE-1-WEST for SPOKE-2-WEST's protected subnet via a next hop of SPOKE-2-WEST's tunnel IP address. But SPOKE-1-WEST does not have the public IP address of SPOKE-2-WEST. This mapping is available in the NHRP database of the hub (VPN-GW1-WEST), and therefore, SPOKE-1-WEST sends an NHRP request to VPN-GW1-WEST to resolve SPOKE-2-WEST's public IP address.
3. While SPOKE-1-WEST is waiting for the NHRP response from VPN-GW1-WEST, it forwards the packet destined to SPOKE-2-WEST's protected subnet via the hub (VPNGW1-WEST). All spoke-to-spoke traffic via the hub will be decrypted and re-encrypted at the hub while waiting for the spoke-to-spoke tunnel to be established. Note that the encryption and decryption at the hub calls for extra processing overhead for the hub and induces latency for spoke-to-spoke traffic, and thus, may not be suitable for certain applications, such as voice.
4. VPN-GW1-WEST forwards the packets it receives from SPOKE-1-WEST and routes them to SPOKE-2-WEST.
5. Meanwhile, VPN-GW1-WEST responds to the NHRP resolution request and informs SPOKE-1-WEST that a direct NHRP mapping exists between SPOKE-1-WEST and SPOKE-2-WEST using the publicly assigned IP address of SPOKE-2-WEST.
6. The SPOKE-1-WEST installs the NHRP mapping from 9.0.0.3 -> 9.1.1.134, which triggers IKE/IPSec to SPOKE-2-WEST. While the IKE/IPSec negotiation is not complete, all data to SPOKE-2-WEST will continue to transit via VPN-GW1-WEST.
7. Upon completion of the IKE and IPSec establishment, packets from HOST-1-WEST to HOST-2-WEST use the direct IPSec-protected GRE tunnel between SPOKE-1-WEST and SPOKE-2-WEST.

The NHRP requests to the hub is initiated by invalid CEF entries, due to the fact that there is no route to the tunnel interface of the spoke without a L3 to L2 lookup. This lookup is what triggers the NHRP request. The initial packets are therefore process switched instead of CEF switched.

One important thing to note is that SPOKE-2-WEST has not resolved a reverse path to SPOKE-1-WEST.

#### Phase 3
Though DMVPN Phase 2 deployment provided spoke-to-spoke tunnels, one of the limitations is maintaining full routing tables on the spokes. Each route for remote spoke networks needs to be a specific route with the next hop pointing to the remote spokeâ€™s tunnel address. This prevents the hub from being able to send down a summarized route to the spokes for a more concise routing table.

Phase 3 overcomes this restriction using NHRP traffic indication messages from the hub to signal to the spokes that a better path exists to reach the target network. This functionality is enabled by configuring **ip nhrp redirect** on the hub and **ip nhrp shortcut** on the spokes. The redirect command tells the hub to send the NHRP traffic indication message while the shortcut command tells the spokes to accept the redirect and install the shortcut route. The hub will now summarize routing information as it is being sent down to the spokes, and is no longer required to preserve reachability information. Because of this, the spokes receive valid routes and CEF entries no longer require a L3 to L2 lookup. So what triggers an NHRP lookup for the target spoke's public IP address? The redirect message tells the spokes they are using a non-optimized path and should do a NHRP lookup for a better path.

The target for the originating router's NHRP request is not the Next Hop Server (NHS), but is instead destined for the target spoke's inside IP address, even though the data path is still through the hub! The target will respond to the NHRP request directly, completely bypassing the hub! The originating router receives the NHRP response, and not only populates its NHRP table, but also rewrites its CEF table with the new entry.

This CEF rewrite procedure is called *CEF shortcut*. With this method, there is no initial process switching required which is one of its main benefits. Here is a brief config showing the commands used.
