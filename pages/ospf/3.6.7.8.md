The **database-filter all** command is used to filter out all routes from being sent to a neighbor. Its creation wasn't to be used as a filter, but for as a means to limit unnecessary transmission by multiple routers in a NBMA network. But when it is used outside that purpose, it's operation is very similar to the RIP **passive-interface** command. It allows neighbor formation, as it does not suppress Hellos, but it stops the advertisements of all LSAs out the interface to the neighbor in question.

There are two ways to issue the command - via the **neighbor** command in router configuration mode or with the **ip ospf** command in interface configuration mode. Both are shown below.
```
R1(config)# router ospf 1
R1(config-router)# neighbor 155.1.0.2 database-filter all out
R1(config-router)# exit
```
```
R1(config)# interface GigabitEthernet0/1.79
R1(config-if)# ip ospf database-filter all out
R1(config-if)# exit
```
