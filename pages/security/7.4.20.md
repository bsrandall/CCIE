IPv6 Device Tracking is a security feature that provides neighbor liveness tracking so that a neighbor table can be updated when an IPv6 host goes offline. This way, all network privileges can be revoked immediately in order to secure the network. It is simple to implement.
```
R1(config)# ipv6 neighbor tracking
```
