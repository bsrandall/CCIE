By default, LDP will generate and advertise labels for every prefix found in the local routing table. If you want to change this behavior and generate labels only for specific prefixes, you may use an access-list to select the prefixes eligible for label generation.
```
R1(config)# access-list 10 permit 150.1.0.0 0.0.255.255
R1(config)# access-list 20 permit 155.1.146.0 0.0.0.255
R1(config)# no mpls ldp advertise-labels
R1(config)# mpls ldp advertise-labels for 10 to 20
```

That will limit outbound advertisements to the defined prefixes and limited to the defined peers. But what about inbound filtering? There is also a method to filter out inbound label bindings based on neighbor IP address and an ACL that defines the prefixes for which labels should be accepted.
```
R1(config)# access-list 1 permit 172.16.0.0 0.0.255.255
R1(config)# mpls label protocol ldp
R1(config)# mpls ldp neighbor 10.200.254.4 labels accept 1
```
