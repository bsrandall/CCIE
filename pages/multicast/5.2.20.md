PIM Elects special designated forwarders (DFs) on every link in the network for use in Bidirectional PIM. A DF is elected based on the rules similar to the ones used in the PIM Assert procedure. The router on the link that has the shortest metric to reach the RP is selected as the DF. After the elections, DF routers are the only routers allowed to forward traffic toward the RP.
