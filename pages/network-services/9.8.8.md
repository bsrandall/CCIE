Embedded Packet Capture (EPC) is an onboard packet capture facility that allows network administrators to capture packets flowing to, through, and from the device. The capture can be analyzed locally or exported for offline analysis such as to Wireshark.

To capture packet data, a capture buffer and a capture point need to be defined. The capture buffer is a named area in memory of a particular size that is used to hold the packet data. The capture point is a traffic transit point where a packet is captured.
```
R1# monitor capture CAP buffer size 32
R1# monitor capture CAP interface GigabitEthernet0/1 out
R1# monitor capture CAP start
```
