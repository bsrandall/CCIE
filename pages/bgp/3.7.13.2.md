Using automatic tunneling techniques along with BGP is the core of MPLS VPNs. In this case we'll use simple manual tunnels along with BGP to better understand possible effects. Two devices peer BGP (this could be eBGP or iBGP session) across a non-BGP-capable router cloud. This configuration means that any attempt to reach a BGP prefix across the non-BGP cloud would result in prefix blackholing. However, if we establish a direct tunnel between the BGP peers and force all packets go across the tunnel, the non-BGP devices will never notice those packets. Thus, the “unknown” addresses will be hidden from the “core” network, only appearing at the edge routers that know about them.

You use a route-map to change the next-hop address to the tunnel IP address in the appropriate direction.
