When you use the as-set parameter to the aggregate-address command, the resulting prefix will inherit “additive” attributes of the specific prefixes. This includes the AS_PATH attributes, condensed into AS_SET and the community attributes, which are grouped together from all prefixes. We will explore community signaling in further detail, but for now remember that any prefix bearing the community attribute value of “no-export” is not advertised to the adjacent ASs.

This can become an issue in situations where the NO\_EXPORT community is involved. If one of the prefixes contains this community then the aggregate will inherit the parameter and the aggregate will not be advertised outside the AS. If this is not the intended implementation, then you can use an **atribute-map** to change the attributes for the newly created summary.
```
R1(config)# route-map EXPORT permit 10
R1(config-route-map)# set community none
R1(config-router)# exit
R1(config)# router bgp 200
R1(config-router)# aggregate-address 112.0.0.0 248.0.0.0 summary-only as-set attribute-map EXPORT
R1(config-router)# exit
```
