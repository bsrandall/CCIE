We saw a host pool configuration on our introductory topic on DHCP servers. Here was the configuration we used:
```
R1(config)# ip dhcp pool INE
R1(dhcp-config)# utilization mark high 80 log
R1(dhcp-config)# network 192.168.17.0/24
R1(dhcp-config)# domain-name internetbrew.com
R1(dhcp-config)# dns server 192.168.17.50 192.168.17.51
R1(dhcp-config)# bootfile tftp://192.168.17.40/client-bootfile
R1(dhcp-config)# default-router 192.168.17.1
R1(dhcp-config)# lease 30
R1(dhcp-config)# option 19 hex 01
R1(dhcp-config)# exit
R1(config)# ip dhcp excluded-address 192.168.17.1 192.168.17.99
```
One thing to note is that once a pool is created, clients are immediately able to obtain an address as long as the DHCP service has not been explictly disabled.
