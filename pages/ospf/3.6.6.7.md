We saw earlier that with OSPF Not-So-Stubby Areas, Type-7 NSSA External LSAs are translated to Type-5 External LSAs by the ABR connecting the NSSA to area 0. When multiple ABRs connect the NSSA to area 0, the ABR with the highest router-id is elected as the Type-7 to Type-5 translator, and is responsible for re-originating the Type-5 LSA into area 0.

The re-originated Type-5 External LSA contains the Forwarding Address for the route to the External network. So even though an ABR won an election to translate the Type-7 LSA, it doesn't mean that it will be in the forwarding path. If other areas have a shorter path to the external route via another ABR, then their traffic will take that path. This is different that a typical Type-5 LSA - usually the forwarding address is not preserved which is why the Type-4 ASBR Summary LSA exists.
