Monitoring the CPU and memory on network devices is a critical monitoring process. You can use SNMP traps and informs for notification when the CPU usage crosses the defined boundaries.
```
R1(config)# snmp-server enable traps cpu threshold
R1(config)# process cpu threshold type total rising 50 interval 5
```
In the above configuration, CPU utilization is polled every 5 seconds and a trap will be sent if CPU usage hits 50%.

You can also configure the memory threshold notification feature to post a syslog message when the amount of free memory shrinks below a pre-defined limit.
```
R1(config)# memory free low-watermark processor 1024
R1(config)# memory reserve critical 512
```
The measurement for these is in KB.
