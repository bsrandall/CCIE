Prefix Lists are a great way to filter routes when you need to filter based on prefix length. Below would be an example.
```
`R1(config)# ip prefix-list PRE-1 seq 5 permit 172.16.1.0/24 le 24
R1(config)# router eigrp 100
R1(config-router)# distribute-list prefix PRE-1 gig0/0 in
R1(config-router)# end
```
`Based on the above configuration, if an advertised route of 172.16.1.8/27 were advertised to the gig0/0 interface, that route would be ignored because the prefix length is not 24.

Prefix lists can be used with either distribute lists or route maps. Prefix lists cannot be used with offset lists.
