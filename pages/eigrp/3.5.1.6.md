Third-party next-hop concept appears only to distance vector protocol, or in the parts of the link-state protocols that exhibit distance-vector behavior. The idea is that a distance-vector update carries explicit next-hop value, which is used by receiving side, as opposed to the “implicit” next-hop calculated as the sending router’s address – the source address in the IP header carrying the routing update. Such “explicit” next-hop is called “third-party” next-hop IP address, allowing for pointing to a different next-hop, other than advertising router.

EIGRP by default provides an explicit “third-party” address in its Routing updates. You can change this behavior by issuing the **ip next-hop self eigrp** global configuration command.

When redistributing RIP or OSPF into EIGRP, EIGRP will propagate the 3rd Party Next-Hop from the redistributed routes if they exist (you may need to issue **no ip next-hop self eigrp \<AS\>**). For some reason, it does not insert the 3rd Party next-hop information when Redistributing BGP into the EIGRP domain. With named mode, **next-hop-self** is under the af-interface.
```
R1(config)# router eigrp NAMED_MODE
R1(config-router)# address-fmaily ipv4 autonomous-system 500
R1(config-router-af)# af-interface default
R1(config-router-af-interface)# no next-hop-self
R1(config-router-af)# end
```

INE has a blog entry relating to the behavior of next-hop for all the routing protocols located [here][1].
