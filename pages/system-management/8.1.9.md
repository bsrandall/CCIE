As we mentioned in the previous topic, you can use standard access lists to limit which SNMP managers can interact with an IOS device running a SNMP agent. Since the SNMPv2c security is weak with only a community string for authentication and authorization, it is highly recommended to use an access list when using version 2c.
```
R1(config)# access-list 10 permit host 192.168.17.100
R1(config)# snmp-server community TEST 10
```
