EIGRP default network is a carry over from IGRP when there was no way to carry a default route in an IGRP packet. The way it works is a little weird. You define a default-network and the network listed is flagged in the EIGRP update as a candidate default route.

The router will then choose the best candidate default route as the default network, and the **next hop** toward the default network is chosen as the gateway of last resort. So to define a particular router as the gateway of last resort, you need to find a network that uses that router as its next hop, and define that with the **ip default-network** command.
```
R1(config)# ip default-network 192.168.17.0
R1(config)# end
```
