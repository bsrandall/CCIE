You can optionally add authentication to your NTP configuration. NTP authentication is based on two concepts. First, NTP packets that can change the local clock must be authenticated. Second, authenticated NTP packets are signed using an MD5 signature, and carry the signing key index inside.

Only the client or peer whose clock would be updated by NTP requires authentication. However, authentication keys must be enabled on both sides of the client/server or peer-to-peer relationship.
```
R1(config)# ntp authenticate
R1(config)# ntp authentication-key CISCO
```
