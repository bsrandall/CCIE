The OSPF flooding reduction feature is a slight modification of the demand circuits designed to reduce additional traffic on links arising from a periodic LSA refresh. It uses the same mechanism to eliminate the need for the periodic LSA refresh. Generally routers are not immediately connected to the link and cannot identify if it is configured as a demand circuit or a flooding reduction link - the database representation of both types of links is the same.

The main difference between flooding reduction and demand circuits is that former suppresses only periodic LSA refreshes; it does not suppress periodic hello packets. Thus, the flooding reduction feature does not impair the detection of a neighbor router going down.

Flooding reduction links have the same constraints as demand circuits. In particular, all routers in the area must support the demand circuit feature in order for flooding reduction to work. Troubleshooting techniques for both demand circuits and flooding reduction links are also common.
```
R1(config)# interface GigabitEthernet0/1.146
R1(config-if)# ip ospf flood-reduction
R1(config-if)# exit
```

On interface GigabitEthernet0/1.146 as configured above, no periodic LSA refreshes are sent over the link but hellos are.
