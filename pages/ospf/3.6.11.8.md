OSPFv3 can be configured in Multi AddressFamily mode just as we saw in EIGRP. With Cisco IOS, we can now configure both IPv4 and IPv6 in Multi AF mode, as well as the traditional router configuration mode.

There are a few caveats for using Multi-AF mode with IPv4 routing. First, IPv6 must be enabled on the link, even if you are not routing IPv6. Because of this most implementations use Multi AF mode for IPv6 configuration. Second, a single IPv4 or IPv6 OSPFv3 process running multiple instances on the same interface is not supported.
```
R1(config)# router ospfv3 1
R1(config-router)# address-family ipv6 unicast
R1(config-router-af)# exit
```
As with router mode, much of the enablement is still done at the interface level, but using the **ospfv3** command instead of the **ipv6 ospf** commands we saw earlier.
```
R1(config)# interface GigabitEthernet0/1.146
R1(config-if)# ospfv3 1 ipv6 area 5
R1(config-if)# exit
```
