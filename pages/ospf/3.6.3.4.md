For point-to-point networks, there really is no notion of changing cost per neighbor as changing the cost of an interface directly affects the cost to that neighbor.  But what about Point-to-Multipoint networks where changing the cost of an interface would alter the cost to all neighbors?

Cisco IOS allows setting the cost on a per-neighbor basis when the network type is Point-to-Multipoint. This is done under router configuration mode.
```
R1(config)# router ospf 1
R1(config-router)# neighbor 155.1.0.3 cost 200
R1(config-router)# exit
```
