An application level gateway is an application that translates IP address information *inside* the payload of an application packet. NAT rules may alter the IP addresses and TCP/UDP ports in the IP headfer of a packet. However, that same header information may exist inside the payload of a packet, and used for operational purpose by the receiving device. NAT ALGs work by rewriting that IP and port information inside the payload, to ensure the application works as intended.

By default, IOS has some fixups built-in for applications that contain IP and port information within the payload. If for some reason you need to disable it, use the **no-payload** keyword.
```
R1(config)# ip nat inside source static tcp 192.168.0.1 19 30.0.0.20 5000 no-payload
```
