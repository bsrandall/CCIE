BGP implementation in Cisco IOS has a special feature that looks similar to TTL scoping in IP networks. It is called BGP maximum AS limit and is enabled by using the BGP process command **bgp maxas-limit** . This feature sets the maximum number of AS elements allowed in the AS_PATH attribute. The regular counting rules apply: AS_SET element counts as one, and AS_CONFED elements are ignored when counting. The default value for this limit is 75 AS elements, and this may be exceeded if AS_PATH prepending is used extensively.
