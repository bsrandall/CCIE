Within the route-map statement, there is an option when using `ip next-hop` of `verify-availability`. This article will describe what it does and the two flavors of utilization.

If used solely by itself, `verify-availabilty` uses CDP to establish that the next-hop IP address is reachable. If the IP address used is in the CDP neighbor table, then the next-hop is deemed accessible, otherwise it is not.

`verify-availability` can be extended to also use a tracking object. Here is an example of that configuration.
```
R2(config)#route-map PBR permit 10
R2(config-route-map)#match ip address HTTP-SERVER
R2(config-route-map)#set ip next-hop verify-availability 192.168.24.4 1 track 1
```

Sometimes this is called Reliable Policy Routing.
