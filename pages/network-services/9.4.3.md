When an IOS router is set up as a DNS forwarder for clients, the router will forward DNS requests to the upstream name server as long as the connection is available. When the router loses reachability to the DNS servers, it will respond to all DNS queries with a pre-configured IP address which allows you to specify an internal HTTP server that can display an informational message.
```
R1(config)# ip dns server
R1(config)# ip name-server 192.168.17.1 192.168.17.2
R1(config)# ip domain-lookup
R1(config)# ip dns spoofing 192.168.17.100
```
