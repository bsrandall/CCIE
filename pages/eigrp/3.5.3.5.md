When an EIGRP Summary route is created, either by auto-summary or by manual summarization, what should the metric of the route be? EIGRP will actually choose the smallest metric among the component routes and use that as the metric for the summary route. Should the metric for that component route change, then the metric for the summary is also updated.

If there are many component routes to be summarized and the component routes are frequently updated, the metrics are also updated frequently, and thus a high CPU state may be caused depending on the configuration. To deal with such a situation, the **summary-metric** command was implemented. The command is issued in EIGRP router configuration mode.
```
R1(config)# router eigrp 100
R1(config-router)# summary-metric 10.1.0.0/16 10000 200 255 0 1500
R1(config-router)# end
```

You can also use the **summary-metric** to set the Administrative Distance of the summary. This is useful in situations where you want to poison the route by setting the *distance* to 255.
