ORIGIN is a well-known mandatory attribute that specifies the origin of the routing update. When BGP has multiple routes to the same destination, it uses the ORIGIN as one factor in determining the preferred route. It specifies one of the following origins:
- IGP: route was initiated by the **network** or **aggregate-address** command
- EGP: obsolete and you will not see
- Incomplete: route was redistributed into BGP

For the most part this is considered a legacy attribute. You can set the attribute using a route-map and the **set-origin** command, should the need arise.
