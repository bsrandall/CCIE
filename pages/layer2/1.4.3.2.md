The EdgePort corresponds to the 802.1D PortFast feature. The idea is that all ports directly connected to end stations cannot create bridging loops in the network. Therefore, there is no danger in allowing these ports to skip the listening and learning stages and transition directly to a forwarding state. Edge ports are critical to RSTP setup and design. We always want to declare Edge Ports, as this greatly reduces the disruption to the network during the sync process, in addition to when devices connected to Edge ports connect and disconnect to the network.

An Edge Port that receives a BPDU immediately loses its Edge Port designation and becomes a regular STP port.

To keep the same naming convention, we still use *portfast* when configuring edge ports.
```
SW1(config)# interface GigabitEthernet0/1
SW1(config-if)# spanning-tree portfast
```
Alternatively, you can globally specify all ports to be edge ports, and then on a port-by-port basis disable the feature for non-edge ports.
```
SW1(config)# spanning-tree portfast default
SW1(config)# interface GigabitEthernet0/2
SW1(config-if) no spanning-tree portfast
```
There may be situations where a trunk port leads to edge devices only. In those situations, you need to use the keyword *trunk*.
```
SW1(config)# interface GigabitEthernet0/1
SW1(config-if)# spanning-tree portfast trunk
```
