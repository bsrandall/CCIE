Cisco Disovery Protocol is a Layer 2 management protocol that is used to exchange basic device information. It can be helpful when first walking into a network or for troubleshooting directly connected devices. It is a Cisco proprietary protocol. CDP is enabled by default on most IOS versions. CDP packets are multicast to 0100.0CCC.CCCC and devices listen on that address. Advertisements are sent out every 60 seconds by default. Information from neighbors is stored in the CDP table. You can enable CDP globally by using the below line:
```
R1(config)# cdp run
```
Alternatively, you can configure CDP to run on a per-interface basis.
```
R1(config-if)# cdp enable
```
There are two configurable timers for CDP. the **cdp timer** sets the frequency of the CDP transmissions, which again, is set to 60 seconds by default. The **cdp holdtime** timer sets a limit as to how long information should be stored in the CDP table without being refreshed before it is discarded.

To send CDP version 2 announcements, you must explicitly configure it using the following:
```
R1(config)# cdp advertise-v2
```
