A RARP server is a very simple service for supplying an IP address to a client. Think of it as a minnie minnie DHCP server. The only configuration items are the arp entries for the clients, and declaring an interface as hosting a RARP server.
```
R1(config)# arp 155.1.146.4 0007.ebde.5622 arpa
R1(config)# interface GigabitEthernet0/1
R1(config-if)# ip rarp-server 155.1.146.1
R1(config-if)# ip helper-address 155.1.58.8
```
