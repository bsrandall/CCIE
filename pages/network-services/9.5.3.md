Many times we see NAT addresses identified by access lists. This works just fine if the address space to be defined is simple and straighforward. If not, we can also use route maps in an **ip nat** statement. Route maps can do two functions with NAT:
- match access-lists
- match egress interfaces or next-hops

A common example that is used is if you are using PAT but have two ISPs. This is basically a poor man's redundancy solution. Let's say your two ISPs are connected to GigabitEthernet0/0 and GigabitEthernet0/1 and your LAN is GigabitEthernet0/2 addressed with 192.168.0.0/24.
```
R1(config)# ip access-list standard TOWARDS_OUTSIDE
R1(config-std-acl)# permit ip 192.168.0.0 0.0.0.255
R1(config-std-acl)# exit
R1(config)# route-map TOWARDS_ISP1 permit 10
R1(config-route-map)# match ip address TOWARDS_OUTSIDE
R1(config-route-map)# match interface GigabitEthernet0/0
R1(config-route-map)# exit
R1(config)# route-map TOWARDS_ISP2 permit 10
R1(config-route-map)# match ip address TOWARDS_OUTSIDE
R1(config-route-map)# match interface GigabitEthernet0/1
R1(config-route-map)# exit
R1(config)# ip nat inside source route-map TOWARDS_ISP1 interface GigabitEthernet0/0 overload
R1(config)# ip nat inside source route-map TOWARDS_ISP2 interface GigabitEthernet0/1 overload
```
The **match ip address** statement in the route map is not really necesarry, but just shown here as an option.
