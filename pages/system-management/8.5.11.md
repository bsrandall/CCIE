IOS includes the UNIX remote command execution (RSH) environment. No password is required to access the local system, an entry just needs to exist in the local ".rhosts"-like table. The table maps a remote station's IP and username to the local username and privilege level.
```
R1(config)# ip rcmd remote-host R1 150.2.2.2 R2 enable
R1(config)# ip rcmd rcp-enable
R1(config)# ip rcmd rsh-enable
```
As you can see, commonly the target router's hostname is used as the rcmd username. When an inbound remote shell request is detected, the local router does a lookup on the remote host's IP address in the ".rhosts" table, and if the username specified by the remote host matches the local username AND the source username used by the remote system matches the remote username, then remote shell access is granted. The **enable** keyword provides enable access, otherwise, just exec privilege level 1 access is granted.

Remote users can also use the remote copy (RCP) feature to transfer files from the router to the remote system. IOS can also act as an rsh and rcp client. The local hostname of the IOS device will always be used as the source hostname, but the remote (target) username can be changed,
```
R1(config)# ip rcmd remote-username RCP
```
