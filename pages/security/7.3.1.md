Routers typically respoind with ICMP Unreachable messages when dropping packets for some reason. The 3 most common reasons are Network or Host unreachable, administratively prohibited, and fragmentation needed but DF bit set.

There are 3 ways to control the generation of ICMP unreachable messages:
1. Disable generation of ICMP unreachables out of the specified interface with the **no ip unreachables** command.
2. Control the rate of ICMP unreachable messages sent by the router with the global command **ip icmp rate-limit unreachable \<once-per-this-ms\>
3. Control the rate of packet-too-big messages by setting a separate rate-limit with **ip icmp rate-limit unreachable DF \<once-per-this-ms\>

Since this feature may be turned on during the lab which may limit your ability to confirm Layer 2 or Layer 3 connectivity, you may want to remember this command to check and see if ICMP messages are being filtered:
```
R1# show ip interface GigabitEthernet0/1 | include unreach
```
