Perform this task to adjust the delay interval between routing table walks for BGP next-hop address tracking.

You can increase the performance of this feature by tuning the delay interval between full routing table walks to match the tuning parameters for the Interior Gateway protocol (IGP). The default delay interval is 5 seconds. This value is optimal for a fast-tuned IGP. In the case of an IGP that converges more slowly, you can change the delay interval to 20 seconds or more, depending on the IGP convergence time.

BGP next-hop address tracking significantly improves the response time of BGP to next-hop changes in the RIB. However, unstable Interior Gateway Protocol (IGP) peers can introduce instability to BGP neighbor sessions. We recommend that you aggressively dampen unstable IGP peering sessions to reduce the possible impact to BGP.
```
R1(config)# router bgp 65534
R1(config-router)# address-family ipv4 unicast
R1(config-router-af)# bgp next hop trigger delay 20
R1(config-router-af)# exit
```
