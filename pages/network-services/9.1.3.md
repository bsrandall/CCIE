A *track list* is just a list of tracking objects that are combined into one tracking state with the use of boolean AND or boolean OR. You can use the **not** keyword before an object to have the reverse state of the configured object. You can also use **percentage** and **weight** to  


There might be times where you need to track an object list, but you need to measure somewhere between AND (all) and OR (one). This is where **weight** and **percentage** thresholds come to your aid.
```
R1(config)# track 1 list boolean and
R1(config-track)# object 1
R1(config-track)# object 2
R1(config-track)# object 3 not
R1(config-track)# exit
```
You can choose to measure the tracked list state by a weight threshold. You assign a weight to each object in the list, where the weights per object do not have to be equal. The state of the tracked list is determined by whether or not the threshold was met.
```
R1(config)# track 2 list threshold percentage
R1(config-track)# object 1
R1(config-track)# object 2
R1(config-track)# object 3
R1(config-track)# threshold weight up 30 down 10
R1(config-track)# exit
```

You can also use a percentage threshold in cases where all objects are weighted evenly, but you still want state to be measured somehwere between one and all.
```
R1(config)# track 3 list threshold percentage
R1(config-track)# object 1
R1(config-track)# object 2
R1(config-track)# object 3
R1(config-track)# threshold percentage up 51 down 10
R1(config-track)# exit
```
