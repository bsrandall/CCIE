Ciscoâ€™s implementation of OSPFv2 does not support Multicast OSPF, which is advertised through LSA Type-6. Upon receipt of this LSA type from a non-Cisco OSPF router, a log message is generated. To disable this, issue the **ignore lsa
mospf** command under the OSPF process.


A neighbor relationship cannot occur if two OSPF neighbors have different MTU values on their interfaces. If the MTU difference is by design, the interface-level command **ip ospf mtu-ignore** removes this requirement from the adjacency establishment. There really should be few practical reasons to ever need this command.

The **ip ospf name-lookup** command performs DNS resolution on the OSPF router-id value in show commands to simplify the identification of neighbors.
```
R10#show ip ospf neighbor
Neighbor ID     Pri   State           Dead Time   Address         Interface
R8                1   FULL/BDR        00:00:36    155.1.108.8     GigabitEthernet1.108
 ```
 Usually you would see the Router ID in the Neighbor ID column above.
