The leak map allows you to advertise a specific prefix within the range of a summary advertisement, as well as the summary itself.To configure the EIGRP leak map, there are 3 steps.
1. Create an ACL or Prefix List to match the routes you want to leak.
2. Create a Route Map and call the ACL into it.
3. Map the Route Map with **ip summary-address eigrp** with the *leak* keyword
