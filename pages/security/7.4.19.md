The IPv6 First Hop Binding Table is a database composed of IPv6 to link-layer address bindings. The information is collected from ND protocol snooping, if enabled, as well as any static bindings that are manually configured. To manually configure an entry, use this syntax:
```
R1(config)#ipv6 neighbor 2001::1 GigabitEthernet0/1 1001.3ad2.0001
```

You can also configure binding table recovery in case the device reboots.
