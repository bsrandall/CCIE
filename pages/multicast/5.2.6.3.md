Routers that are Candidate BSRs in a PIM domain are usually also and Candidate RPs. They typically identify themselves by means of an IPv4 or IPv6 address, which is typically that of a loopback interface.

Each C-BSR is assigned a priority between 0 and 255, with the default being 0. As soon as a router is configured as a C-BSR it sets a bootstrap timer to 130 seconds and listens for a Bootstrap message. These Bootstrap messages advertse the originator's priority and BSR IP address. When a C-BSR receives a Bootstrap message, it compares the originator’s priority with its own priority. If the originator has a higher priority, the receiver resets its bootstrap timer and contin- ues to listen. If the receiver’s priority is higher, it declares itself the BSR and begins send- ing Bootstrap messages every 60 seconds. If the priorities are equal, the higher BSR IP address is the tie-breaker.

If a C-BSR’s 130-second bootstrap timer expires, the router assumes that there is no BSR, declares itself the BSR, and begins sending Bootstrap messages every 60 seconds.
