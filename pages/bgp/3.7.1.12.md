Another BGP TCP transport feature is to enable a separate TCP transport session for each address family. This can be done on a per-neighbor basis.
```
R1(config)# router bgp 64512
R1(config-router)# neighbor 10.0.0.2 remote-as 65535
R1(config-router)# neighbor 10.0.0.2 transport multi-session
R1(config-router)#
```
This would be used if you were trying to keep topologies separate that existed between two BGP peers. You would be more likely to see this in a service provider network.
