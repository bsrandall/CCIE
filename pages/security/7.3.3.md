Control Plane Protection (CPPr) is similar to Control Plane Policing (CoPP), but CPPr can be fine-tuned to get more granular control over control plane traffic. CPPr divides the aggregate control plane into three entities, known as subinterfaces:
1. host: control traffic destined for one of the router interfaces. It does not include Non-IP Layer 2 protocol packets such as CDP or ARP
2. transit: control plane traffic that is software switched by the route processor, not destined for the local device
3. CEF-exception: this is non-IP control plane traffic such as ARP, eBGP, OSPF, LDP, etc)

CPPr includes the following additional control plane protection features:
- The port filtering feature provides for policing/dropping of packets going to closed or nonlistening TCP/UDP ports
- Queue thresholding limits the number of packets for a specified protocol that will be allowed in the control plane input queue

As with CoPP, MQC **class-map**s house ACLs and other match lines to classify interesting traffic and then a **policy-map** is used to police or drop the traffic. Then, the service policy is applied to the control plane, just as we saw with CoPP.

```
R1(config)# ip access-list extended BGP
R1(config-ect-acl)# permit tcp 192.1698.0.0 0.0.0.255 eq bgp 10.10.0.0 0.0.0.255 gt 1024
R1(config-ect-acl)# exit
R1(config)# ip access-list extended OTHER
R1(config-ect-acl)# permit icmp any any ttl-exceeded
R1(config-ect-acl)# permit icmp any any packet-too-big
R1(config-ect-acl)# exit
R1(config)# class-map match-all ROUTING
R1(config-cmap)# match access-group BGP
R1(config-cmap)# class-map match-all NORMAL
R1(config-cmap)# match access-group OTHER
R1(config-cmap)# exit
R1(config)# policy map CONTROL
R1(config-pmap)# class ROUTING
R1(config-pmap-c)# police 100 pps conform-action transmit exceed-action drop
R1(config-pmap-c)# class NORMAL
R1(config-pmap-c)# police 50 pps conform-action transmit exceed-action drop
R1(config-pmap-c)# exit
R1(config-pmap)# exit
R1(config)# control-plane host
R1(config-cp)# service-policy input CONTROL
R1(config-cp)# exit
```
So we see this is applied to the "host" subinterface, but what if we were applying it to the transit subinterface? Easy, just use the transit keyword instead.
```
R1(config)# control-plane transit
R1(config-cp)# service-policy input CONTROL
R1(config-cp)# exit
```
Now, if we were using CPPr for the CEF-exception subinterface, our access-lists would be matching non-IP traffic, but we would designate our service policy the same as above, but just using the **cef-exception** keyword.
```
R1(config)# control-plane cef-exception
R1(config-cp)# service-policy input CONTROL
R1(config-cp)# exit
```
