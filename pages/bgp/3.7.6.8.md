When using the **as-set** keyword with BGP aggregation, some of the specific prefix attributes get mixed together in the new prefix. Specifically, you should watch out for the resulting AS_SET and list of community attributes. Previously, you learned how to modify some of the aggregated prefix attributes. However, you cannot manipulate an important attribute such as AS_SET directly. Instead, you may specify the specific prefixes that will be used to make up the attribute list for the aggregate prefix. This is accomplished by using the advertise-map parameter to the aggregate-address command. The route-map used as advertise-map should permit specific prefixes to be used to compose the aggregate attributes, such as AS_SET. You can use only access-list, prefix-list, or as-path access-lists to match the specific prefixes. Information from the prefixes denied by the route-map is not used when constructing the resulting summary-prefix. You may use this method to remove the prefixes with unwanted BGP community attributes as well.
```
R1(config)# ip prefix-list AS300 permit 222.22.3.0/24
R1(config)# route-map ADVERTISE_MAP deny 10
R1(config-route-map)# match ip address prefix-list AS300
R1(config-route-map)# route-map ADVERTISE_MAP permit 20
R1(config-route-map)# exit
R1(config)# router bgp 200
R1(config-router)# aggregate-address 222.22.0.0 255.255.252.0 summary-only as-set advertise-map ADVERTISE_MAP
```
In the above example, prefixes from AS 300 will not be used to compile the summary attributes. So, for example, AS 300 will not be in the AS_SET.
