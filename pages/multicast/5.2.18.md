Remember that source registration is performed by the PIM DR router, and every register message contains the original multicast packet, which includes the IP address of the multicast source and the group destination address. If the RP denies the registration, it sends a PIM Register- Stop to the DR immediately and never builds the SPT toward the source. Most of the time, this is due to an RPF failure.
