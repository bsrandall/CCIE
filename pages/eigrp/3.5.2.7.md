EIGRP has a nice feature that allows us to control *unequal* cost load balancing on a router. We control this with the **variance** EIGRP router command. The variance is a multiplier - traffic will be placed on any link that has a metric less than the best path multiplied by the variance. Variance can be any value between 1 and 128. The default value is 1.

The router then divides the largest path’s metric by each route’s metric to determine the traffic share for that route. You can alter this behavior with the **traffic-share** command. The default behavior is **traffic-share balanced**. If you wanted traffic to only flow across the path with the lowest cost, you would use **traffic-share min across-interfaces**. The only real benefit of using this command in combination with the **variance** command would be to have the routes pre-loaded into the routing table for faster convergence.

The default load balancing method in CEF is per-destination load balancing. If you have different interface types, such as Tunnel and Serial, then in order to achieve load balancing you would need to enable per-packet load balancing with the **ip load-sharing per-packet** interface configuration command.
