For RIP, you can force the router to validate the source IP address of incoming routing updates by using the **validate-update-source** router configuration command. This forces IOS to ensure that the source IP address of incoming routing updates is on the same IP network as one address defined for the receiving interface.

Disabling split horizon on the incoming interface will also cause the system to perform this validation check.

This is now the default. If for some reason you have reconfigured a neighbor router to send a different IP address in the routing updates (the INE lab example was using ip unnumbered), then you would need to issue the **no validate-update-source command**.
```
R1(config)# router rip
R1(config-router)# no validate-update-source
```
