You should be familiar with the different terminal line settings available in IOS. At the end of the article I have provided a list of all the first-level line configuration commands. This is not a short list. I will highlight some of the more frequently used items.

The **absolute-timeout** command sets an interval after which a line will timeout, regardless of user activity.
```
R1(config-line)# absolute-timeout 5
```

The **access-class** command is used to designate an ACL to filter connections
```
R1(config-line)#access-class ?
  <1-199>      IP access list
  <1300-2699>  IP expanded access list
  WORD         Access-list name
```

**exec-timeout** establishes the inactivity timeout period for the terminal line. The first number is minutes and the second number is seconds.
```
R1(config-line)# exec-timeout 2 0
```

If you want to set the number of lines on the screen for a line, use this:
```
R1(config-line)# length 20
```


The **lockable command allows users to lock a line.
```
R1(config-line)# lockable
```

The **refuse-message** is used to set a banner for when connections are refused.
```
R1(config-line)# refuse-message # Sorry this line is already in use #
```

The **transport preferred none** command is handy if you cannot specify **no ip domain-lookups**. The reason when you type an unknown command that a telnet session is initiated is because the default preferred transport is telnet. By setting it to none the only way telnet will be initiated is if it is explicitly called.
```
R1(config-line)# transport preferred none
```

As promised, here is a full listing of the first level configuration items for a terminal line.
