The default reference bandwidth for Cisco OSPF is $$10^8$$ or 100Mb. Because of this a FastEthernet interface by default will have the same cost as a GigabitEthernet Interface, which would equal 1. You can use **auto-cost reference-bandwidth** in router configuration mode to change the reference bandwidth. When changing, you should change throughout the OSPF AS.
```
R1(config)# router ospf 1
R1(config-router)# auto-cost reference-bandwidth 1000
R1(config-router)# exit
```
The above would set the reference bandwidth to 1Gb.
