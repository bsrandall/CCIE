The Auto-RP mapping agent allows for the filtering of incoming RP announcements sent by RP candidates. This type of filtering applies only to Auto-RP announcements received by listening to the 224.0.1.39 multicast IP address and thus is only effective on Mapping Agents.

You configure a filtering statement using the following syntax: **ip pim rp-announce-filter \[group-list \<access-list\> \| rp-list \<access-list\>\]** . All access-lists are either numbered or named standard ACLs. RP announcements are inspected, and if a match is found for the group and the RP IP address, the action is taken based on the “permit” or “deny” statement. If you omit the rp-list keyword, any announcements containing groups matching the group-list are matched. If you omit the group-list parameter, all updates from the RPs in rp-list are matched.
```
R1(config)# ip access-list standard R10_GROUPS
R1(config-acl)# deny 224.110.11.100
R1(config-acl)#exit
R1(config)# ip access-list standard RP1
R1(config-acl)# permit 150.1.1.6
R1(config-acl)#exit
R1(config)# ip pim send rp-discovery Loopback0 scope 10
R1(config)# ip pim rp-announce-filter rp-list RP1 group-list R10_GROUPS
R1(config)# exit
```
