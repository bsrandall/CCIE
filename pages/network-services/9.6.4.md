IP Accounting MAC Address is comparable to the IP Accounting (Layer 3) feature. However, MAC addresses are collected instead of IP addresses, and there is no concept of a checkpoint database. IP Accounting MAC Address calculates the total number of packets and bytes for IP traffic on LAN interfaces, based on the source and destination MAC addresses. It also records a time stamp for the last packet received or sent.

The maximum number of MAC addresses that can be stored at the network element for each physical interface is 512 entries for input and an additional 512 MAC addresses for output traffic. After the maximum is reached, subsequent MAC addresses are ignored.
```
R1(config-if)# ip accounting mac-address input
R1(config-if)# ip accounting mac-address output
```
