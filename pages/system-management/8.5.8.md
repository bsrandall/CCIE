With IOS, if no **debug condition** commands are entered, when debugging begins the debugging process will output information from all interfaces. Conditional debugging is a way to only log the debug messages you are wanting to see in the output. Here are the options from conect help:
```
R1#debug condition ?
  called       called number
  calling      calling
  cpl          Cisco Provisioning Language debugging
  glbp         interface group
  interface    interface
  ip           IP address
  mac-address  MAC address
  match-list   apply the match-list
  profile      Media Services Profile
  standby      interface group
  username     username
  vcid         VC ID
  vrf          Virtual Routing and Forwarding
  xconnect     Xconnect conditional debugging on segment pair
```

IP and the interface options are useful in many situations. Configuration is straightforward.
```
R1(config)# debug condition interface GigabitEthernet0/1
R1(config)# debug condition ip 150.1.1.1
```
To then see the debug conditions set, use **show debug condition**.
```
R1#show debug condition

Condition 1: ip 150.1.1.1 (0 flags triggered)
Condition 2: interface Gi0/1 (1 flags triggered)
	Flags: Gi0/1
```
Note that these conditions survive an **undebug all** command. To clear them, you must use **undebug condition**.
```
R1#undebug condition all
Removing all conditions may cause a flood of debugging
messages to result, unless specific debugging flags
are first removed.

Proceed with the removal of all conditions? [yes/no]: yes
2 conditions have been removed
R1#
```
