Normally, routes are propagated regardless of the existence of a different path. The BGP conditional advertisement feature uses the **non-exist-map** and the **advertise-map** keywords of the **neighbor advertise-map** command in order to track routes by the route prefix. If a route prefix is not present in output of the **non-exist-map** command, then the route specified by the **advertise-map** command is announced. This feature is useful for multihomed networks, in which some prefixes are advertised to one of the providers only if information from the other provider is not present (this indicates a failure in the peering session or partial reachability).
The conditional BGP announcements are sent in addition to the normal announcements that a BGP router sends to its peers.
```
R1(config)# access-list 60 permit 128.16.16.0 0.0.0.255
R1(config)# access-list 65 permit 192.168.50.0 0.0.0.255
R1(config)# route-map NON-EXIST permit 10
R1(config-route-map)# match ip address 65
R1(config-route-map)#exit
R1(config)# route-map ADVERTISE permit 10
R1(config-route-map)# match ip address 60
R1(config-route-map)#exit  
R1(config)# router bgp 64512
R1(config-router)# neighbor 10.10.10.2 advertise-map ADVERTISE non-exist-map NON-EXIST
R1(config-router)# exit
```
In this example, if the 192.168.50.0/24 prefix does not exist in R1â€™s BGP table, then it will advertise the 128.16.16.0/24 prefix to neighbor 10.10.10.2.

The conditional advertisement process is triggered by the BGP scanner process, which runs every 60 seconds.
