With release 12.2(13)T, Cisco added IOS support for TCP and RTP header compression using MQC. This greatly simplified the configuration. Just as with other MQC features, you need to define class-maps and policy-maps. There is one particular configuration command that enables the feature, **compression header ip \[tcp \| rtp\]**. This is applied inside the policy-map for the class you want to affect.

There is a caveat compared to other MQC configurations. When compressing headers, you must do so one each router connected by a point-to-point connection. if you only configure one side, the far side router will drop the packets upon arrival.

The configuration is simple as usual with MQC. You classify the type of traffic on which you want to do header compression in a class map first. Then you define the header compression in as policy-map. Finally, the service-policy is applied to the interface in the outbound direction.
```
R1(config)# class-map RTP
R1(config-cmap)# match protocol rtp audio
R1(config-cmap)# exit
R1(config)# policy-map COMPRESS_RTP
R1(config-pmap)# class RTP
R1(config-pmap-c)# priority 30
R1(config-pmap-c)# compress header ip rtp
R1(config-pmap-c)# exit
R1(config-pmap)# exit
R1(config)# interface GigabitEthernet0/1
R1(config-if)# service-policy output COMPRESS_RTP
R1(config-if)# end
```

Just remember, a similar configuration would need to be applied to R2. You can then see statistics about the number of packets compressed using **show policy-map interface GigabitEthernet0/1**.
```
R1#show policy-map interface gig0/1
 GigabitEthernet0/1

  Service-policy output: COMPRESS_RTP

                106560 bytes saved, 66240 bytes sent

                100% hit ratio, five minute miss rate 0 misses/sec, 0 max

```

One other thing to note. if you do not use the **tcp** or **rtp** keywords after **compress**, then IOS performs both TCP and RTP header compression for that class.
