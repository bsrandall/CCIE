For the CCIE, the amount of information that you need to know on DNS is limited. You need to know how it should be set up as an authoritative server for a zone and how it should be configured to operate as a caching server to service clients.

First, let's look at how to set up the DNS resolvers on an IOS device. A resolver is no different than configuring DNS on you PC - it defines the name servers that will perform name lookups for you. The most used way to set this up is with the **ip name-server** command.
```
R1(config)# ip domain-lookup
R1(config)# ip name-server 192.168.17.1 192.168.17.2
```

Note that the resolvers are the name servers that the *router* itself uses when it needs to perform a lookup. This is different that the DNS Forwarders, which are the DNS servers the router uses to answer incoming DNS queries from clients. If you want to setup the IOS device as a forwarder, you must configure it to answer client requests.
```
R1(config)# ip dns server
```
That's really the only difference between a device only acting as a resolver (requests for self) or if the device will act as a forwarder (requests from others).
