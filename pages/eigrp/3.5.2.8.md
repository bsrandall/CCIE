Add-Path is the capability to advertise more than one best path to a neighbor. By default, EIGRP only advertises its single best path toward a destination, even though it may know of multiple equal paths for that destination. This is a new enhancement to EIGRP and can only be configured in named mode.
```
`R7(config)# router eigrp OTP-TEST
R7(config-router)# address-family ipv4 unicast autonomous-system 100
R7(config-router-af)# Â af-interface GigabitEthernet1.37
R7(config-router-af-interface)# add-paths 2
```
`You must remember that EIGRP Add-Path is not compatible with variance.
