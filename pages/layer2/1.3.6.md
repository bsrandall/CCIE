The **channel-protocol port channel** interface config command guards against misconfigurations of individual links. If you try to set the wrong mode the switch will alert you that it is not compatible with the guard setting. For example, the below would limit port channels to only use PAgP.
```
SW1(config-if)# channel-protocol pagp
```
If you set the protocol by using the **channel-protocol** command, the setting is not overridden by the **channel-group** interface configuration command.
