L2TPv3 is the Layer 2 transport service over an IP network. The Layer 2 frames are encapsulated with an L2TPv3 header and are transported across the IP network. Similar to AToM, L2TPv3 can carry ATM, Frame Relay, HDLC, PPP, Ethernet, ATM, and others. The difference between L2TPv3 and AToM is that AT0M is carried over a MPLS backbone, while L2TPV3 is carried over an IP backbone. A pseudowire is created between the PEs and the Layer 2 frames are encapsulated into an IP packet.
```
R1(config)# pseudowire-class ONE
R1(config-pw-class)# encapsulation l2tpv3
R1(config-pw-class)# exit
R1(config)# interface Serial0/1
R1(config-if)# encapsulation hdlc
R1(config-if)# xconnect 10.1.1.2 27 pw-class ONE
```
See the only real change between this and AToM from a configuration standpoint is the encapsulation type assigned to the pseudowire.
