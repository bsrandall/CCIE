Static Policy NAT is just static NAT with route maps, which allows for the use of mappings to different inside global IP address for the same inside local IP. The route maps classify the traffic to be used with the respective NAT translation. One use case for this is if you have a server with a single inside local address that maps to two different IPs having two separate inside global addresses.
```
R1(config)# route-map TO_ISP1
R1(config-route-map)#  match interface GigabitEthernet0/1
R1(config-route-map)# route-map TO_ISP2
R1(config-route-map)#  match interface GigabitEthernet0/2
R1(config-route-map)#  exit
R1(config)# ip nat inside source static 192.168.17.50 100.100.100.1 route-map TO_ISP1
R1(config)# ip nat inside source static 192.168.17.50 200.200.200.1 route-map TO_ISP2
R1(config)# interface GigabitEthernet0/1
R1(config-if)# ip nat outside
R1(config-if)# interface GigabitEthernet0/2
R1(config-if)# ip nat outside
R1(config-if)# interface GigabitEthernet0/0
R1(config-if)# ip nat inside
R1(config-if)# end
```
Notice that both ISP interfaces use **ip nat outside**. I need to double check this, but you could also use the route maps on the inside local address, you just specify the route-map on the statement directly after the inside local address. A use case for this is if you were wanting to load balance across both ISP interfaces for outbound traffic.
