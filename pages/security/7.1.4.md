VLAN ACLs, or VACLs, are used to provide access control for packets that are in a VLAN. That traffic may enter the VLAN througfh a Layer 2 port or through a Layer 3 port after being routed, and a VACL can be used in either situation to filter the traffic from entering the VLAN. A VACL can also be used to filter traffic from flowing between devices in the same VLAN.

Here are a couple of items to remember about VACLs:
- VACLs use standard and extended IP and MAC ACLs
- IGMP packets are not checked against VACLs
- To apply access control to both bridged and routed traffic, you can use VACLs alone or a combination of VACLs and ACLs
- VACLs are applied on packets before NAT translation
- The action clause in a VACL can be forward, drop, capture, or redirect. Traffic can be optionally logged.

VACLs are configured by using an access-map. As we saw with PACLs, VACLs can use either IP access lists or MAC access lists. Let's look at a brief example.
```
SW1(config)# ip access-list ROUTED permit tcp any any
SW1(config)# vlan access-map BASIC_IP_ACL 10
SW1(config-access-map)# match ip address ROUTED
SW1(config-access-map)# action drop
SW1(config-access-map)# exit
SW1(config)# vlan filter BASIC_IP_ACL vlan-list 2-99
```
We use an access map to match the IP traffic, define an appropriate action (drop, forward, capture, or redirect), and then apply the access map to a VLAN range using the **vlan filter** command.
