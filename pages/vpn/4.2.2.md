Symmetric cryptographic algorithms are based on the sender and receiver of the message knowing and using the same secret key. The sender uses a secret key to encrypt the message, and the receiver uses the same key to decrypt it. The main problem with using the symmetric key approach is finding a way to distribute the key without anyone else finding it out. Anyone who overhears or intercepts the key in transit can later read and modify messages encrypted or authenticated using that key, and can forge new messages. DES, 3DES, and AES are popular symmetric encryption algorithms.

As we saw in the primer, Diffie-Hellman is a solution to secure key exchange using Pre-Shared Keys.

To configure an ISAKMP policy using PSKs, you use the following:
```
R1(config)# crypto isakmp policy 1
R1(config-isakmp)# authentication pre-share
```

By default, a peer's ISAKMP identity is the IP address of the peer. If appropriate, you could change the identity to be the peer's hostname instead. As a general rule, set the identities of all peers the same way--either all peers should use their IP addresses or all peers should use their hostnames.
