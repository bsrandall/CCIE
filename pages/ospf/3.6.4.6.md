OSPF can be configured with multiple MD5 authentication keys.
```
R1(config)# interface GigabitEthernet0/1
R1(config-if)# ip ospf authentication message-digest
R1(config-if)# ip ospf message-digest-key 1 md5 CISCO1
```
```
R1(config)# interface GigabitEthernet0/1
R1(config-if)# ip ospf authentication message-digest
R1(config-if)# ip ospf message-digest-key 2 md5 CISCO2
```
```
R1(config)# interface GigabitEthernet0/1
R1(config-if)# ip ospf authentication message-digest
R1(config-if)# ip ospf message-digest-key 3 md5 CISCO3
```

When multiple keys are configured on an interface, the router will first try to use the Youngest key in its hello messages to its neighbors. When a hello message is received for a neighbor that uses an older (but still configured) key on the local router, the router will then send a hello message signed with each key configured. This will continue until all of its neighbors are confirmed to use the same key at which point the older keys can then be safely removed from configuration.

The rollover concept is a way to allow OSPF to gracefully switch over to using any new Key ID, while making sure that the current adjacencies (using old keys) are not disrupted. The key that is added last is considered to be the new key ID and the prior ones show up as “old keys”.
