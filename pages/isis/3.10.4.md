Routing with IS-IS is heirarchical, just as with OSPF. Instead of areas, we have levels. IS-IS defines 4 levels:
- Level 0 routing: routing between two ES nodes on the same link, or between an ES and its nearest IS
- Level 1 routing: routing between ES nodes in a single area of a domain (intra-area)
- Level 2 routing: routing between ES nodes in different areas of a domain (inter-area)
- Level 3 routing: routing between ES nodes in different domains

With Level 1 routing, IS's share with each other a list of all ES nodes connected to them. With Level 2 routing, ES node information is no longer shared but area prefixes are shared so that Level 2 routers know how to recah other Level 2 routers. Level 2 routing can be considered backbone routing between individual areas of the domain. Level 3 routing in today's world is being handled by BGP. So really, IS-IS is only concerned with Level 1 and 2 routing.
