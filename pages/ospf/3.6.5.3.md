When a router does a routing lookup on a destination, it always chooses the longest match route for the path. This means that if the router is trying to reach the destination 1.2.3.4, it will choose the route 1.2.3.0/24 over 1.2.0.0/18, or 1.2.0.0/16 over 0.0.0.0/0. This principle can be used for traffic engineering purposes by selectively summarizing prefixes into the IGP domain.

You summarize from the ABR to which you do not want traffic to flow, as that will shorten the subnet bits and thus make for a worse match.
