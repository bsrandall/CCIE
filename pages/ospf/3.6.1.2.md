Most of this was covered in the previous topic. Interface level OSPF activation is the newer of the two techniques to enable OSPF on an interface. One thing that was not answered is how to tell which method was used to activate an interface. You can use the below:
```
`R10#sh ip ospf int gig0/1.108
GigabitEthernet0/1.108 is up, line protocol is up
  Internet Address 155.1.108.10/24, Area 3, \<b\>Attached via Network Statement\</b\>
  Process ID 1, Router ID 150.1.10.10, Network Type BROADCAST, Cost: 1
  Topology-MTID    Cost    Disabled    Shutdown      Topology Name
0           1         no          no            Base
  Transmit Delay is 1 sec, State DR, Priority 1
  Designated Router (ID) 150.1.10.10, Interface address 155.1.108.10
  Backup Designated router (ID) 150.1.8.8, Interface address 155.1.108.8
  Timer intervals configured, Hello 10, Dead 40, Wait 40, Retransmit 5
oob-resync timeout 40
Hello due in 00:00:03
  Supports Link-local Signaling (LLS)
  Cisco NSF helper support enabled
  IETF NSF helper support enabled
  Index 1/2/2, flood queue length 0
  Next 0x0(0)/0x0(0)/0x0(0)
  Last flood scan length is 0, maximum is 2
  Last flood scan time is 19 msec, maximum is 25 msec
  Neighbor Count is 1, Adjacent neighbor count is 1
Adjacent with neighbor 150.1.8.8  (Backup Designated Router)
  Suppress hello for 0 neighbor(s)
