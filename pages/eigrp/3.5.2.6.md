Equal Cost Load Balancing is enabled by default for EIGRP. By default EIGRP will install up to 4 equal cost paths in the routing table. You can change this to allow for up to 6 paths with the **max-paths** EIGRP router command. These are equal cost and also guaranteed to be loop free.

The type of load balancing (per packet or per destination) depends on the type of switching being done in the router.
