With Auto-RP, the multicast groups 224.0.1.39 and 224.0.1.40 are central to announcing multicast group and RP information across the network. But because there is no explicit RP information for these groups, they must use dense mode forwarding. This requires the use of pim sparse-dense-mode on all interfaces within the multicast domain. As discussed before, this is not the safest thing to do in a large-scale network. You may want to use the **no ip dm-fallback** global command in such situations or use the Auto-RP Listener feature, discussed in the next post..
