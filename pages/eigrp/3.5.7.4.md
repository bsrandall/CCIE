The router ID is used to identify the originating router for external routes. If an external route is received with the local router ID, the route is discarded. The router ID can be configured with any IP address with two exceptions; 0.0.0.0 and 255.255.255.255 are not legal values and cannot be entered. A unique value should be configured for each router.

As mentioned above, the router-id helps prevent feedback with external routes. With internal-routes the DUAL algorithm takes care of this but that is not useful with external routes.

If the router-id is not specified, the IP address of the highest loopback is used and if no loopbacks then highest IP assigned to an interface.
```
R1(config)# router eigrp 100
R1(config-router)# router-id 4.4.4.4
R1(config-router)# end
```

**show ip eigrp topology \<prefix\>** will show you the router-id as will **show ip protocols | section eigrp**
