Cisco routers support a set of simple TCP and UDP applications that are relatively common standards for IP devices. In IOS 12.0 and higher, these servers are disabled by default for security purposes as they listen for incoming packets from any source. In reality, the applications are really only used for testing. Here are the services:
- Echo: server process responds to any client input by sending back the identical input
- Discard: the server process discards any data sent by the client
- Daytime: the server responds with the current time and date, and then closes the session
- Chargen: the server sends a constant stream of ASCII characters to the client

Chargen can be very useful for testing. It is sometimes referred to as a poor man's traffic generator. The TCP version sends a continuous stream but the UDP version sends one packet back containing data between 0 and 512 bytes long made up of arbitrary character data.
```
R1# telnet 155.1.146.4 chargen
```

In order to use these servers in IOS 12.0 or higher, make sure you enable them:
```
R1(config)# service tcp-small-servers
R1(config)# service udp-small-servers
```
