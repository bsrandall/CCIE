The well-known NO\_EXPORT community instructs the BGP speaker to advertise the prefix only across iBGP peering links. This restricts the prefix to remain within the boundaries of the local AS. One good use of this feature is prefix aggregation. Imagine that your local AS has multiple connections to some other AS. You advertise a summary of all your internal prefixes using the aggregate-address command out of all links. However, you want just the adjacent AS to select the best entry point based on the MED attribute. This could be accomplished by advertising the specific prefixes tagged with NO\_EXPORT community along with the aggregates. The neighboring AS would be able to select the best path based on the specific information (MED) but will not advertise the specifics any further, thus containing the routing information.
