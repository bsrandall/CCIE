Like the other routing protocols, administrative distance can be changed on a per- prefix and per-neighbor basis in OSPF. One key difference, however, is that the address field in the distance command refers to the originator of the prefix into the area, not necessarily the neighbor from which you are learning the route.
```
R1(config)# access-list 10 permit 155.1.146.0
R1(config)# router ospf 1
R1(config-router)# distance 255 150.1.5.5 0.0.0.0 10
R1(config-router)# exit
```
Notice the permit statement above in the access list. It is the opposite of distribute-lists.
