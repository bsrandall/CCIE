I covered this in the previous topic, but it is here for reference as well.  

This feature can be configured to limit the number of prefixes that are accepted into the EIGRP topology table through redistribution from the Routing Information Base (RIB). All sources of redistribution are processed cumulatively. When the maximum-prefix limit is exceeded, all routes learned through redistribution are discarded and redistribution is suspended for the default or user-defined time period. After the penalty time period expires, normal redistribution will occur.
```
R1(config)# router eigrp 100
R1(config-router)# address-family ipv4 vrf RED
R1(config-router-af)# redistribute maximum-prefix 10000 80 reset-time 10 restart 2
R1(config-router-af)# exit
```
