A VTI or Virtual Tunnel Interface simplifies IPsec configuration. The steps leading up to tunnel configuration are similar.

First create the ISAKMP policy.
```
R1(config)# crypto isakmp policy 10
R1(config-isakmp)# authentication pre-share
R1(config-isakmp)# exit
```

Second, define the pre-share key to be used.
```
R1(config)# crypto isakmp key 0 FooB4r address 172.16.0.6
```

Next define the IPsec transform set and profile.
```
R1(config)# crypto ipsec transform-set MyTransformSet esp-3des esp-sha-hmac
```
```
R1(config)# crypto ipsec profile MyProfile
R1(ipsec-profile)# set transform-set MyTransformSet
```
The profile defines the encryption that will be used for all traffic directed toward the tunnel interface we will soon create.

Now, instead of defining a crypto map and access-list to match interesting traffic, we use a tunnel and define the tunnel mode as ipsec ipv4 and reference the IPsec profile we created.
```
R1(config)# interface tun0
R1(config-if)# tunnel mode ipsec ipv4
R1(config-if)# tunnel protection ipsec profile MyProfile
```

The end result is that you can route traffic across the IPsec tunnel just as you could a GRE tunnel - it will even support a dynamic routing protocol since it supports multicast and broadcast across the tunnel.

The advantage compared to GRE over IPsec is that there is no additional overhead related to the GRE header. The disadvanatge is that GRE has the capability to handle non-IP traffic, while our IPsec VTI will not.
