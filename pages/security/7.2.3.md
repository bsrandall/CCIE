Local command authorization uses the concept of privilege levels to decide what commands a user has access to within IOS. These levels range from 0 to 15 and with 3 of those levels being preconfigured.

Level 0: just a few basic commands such as **enable**, **login**, and **exit**.

Level 1: this is the default user exec mode. It has some show commands available.

Level 15: also known as privileged mode or exec mode includes all the commands available in IOS

You can also create custom command sets by assigning higher level commands to lower levels, by revoking commands from lower levels, or by creating custom levels and assigning certain commands to that new level.

The command to assign commands to a certain level is:
```
R1(config)# privilege exec level 7 debug ip rip
```
Note that in this example, level 7 users would have access to the **debgug ip rip** command but they would not have access to the **debug ip eigrp** command unless explicitly given on another line. However if you used:
```
R1(config)# privilege exec all level 7 debug ip
```
then level 7 users would have access to all debug ip * commands, thanks to the "all" keyword.

One thing to remember is that users will only have access to see the commands they have access to when that user does **show running config**.
