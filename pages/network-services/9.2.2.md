If you are familiar with HSRP, VRRP configuration should not be difficult. VRRP is an open standard that is supported by many vendors. Instead of the **standby** interface configuration command, you use the **vrrp** interface command instead. We ill mainly be discussing the differences between VRRP and HSRP in this article.

With VRRP, you are only allowed to modify the Hello timer value, whereas with HSRP you could individually set the Hello and the Holddown timers. All VRRP routers in the same group must share the same Hello timer value. The default timer value is 1 second and the range is from 1 to 255 seconds, unless the **msec** keyword is used, in which case the valid timer range is between 50 and 999 milliseconds.
```
R1(config-if)# vrrp 1 timers advertise 3
R1(config-if)# vrrp 2 timers advertise msec 50
```
Another difference regarding timers is that with VRRP, you can configure a router to learn the timer value from the master virtual router.
```
R1(config-if)# vrrp 1 timers learn
```

As with HSRP, you can use plain text or MD5 authentication.

One handy feature with VRRP is that you can use a single line description for each VRRP group instance on each interface.
```
R1(config-if)# vrrp 1 description THIS IS THE DESCRIPTION FOR VRRP 1
```

Finally, just as we saw with HSRP, you can use tracking objects to change the priority level of interfaces.
