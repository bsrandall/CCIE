EIGRP sends out Hello packets every 5 seconds by default on high bandwidth links and 60 seconds on low bandwidth multipoint links. Almost all of todayâ€™s networks classify as high bandwidth, with the only exception being T1 or slower Frame Relay circuits. This rate can be adjusted on a per interface basis.
```
`R1(config-if)# ip hello-interval eigrp 100 2
```
`
The hold time is by default 3 times the hello interval, and it can also be adjusted on a per interface basis.
```
`R1(config-if)# ip hold-time eigrp 100 6
```
`
The hello and hold times are carried in hello packets, which is the main reason why these timers do not have to match on neighboring routers in order for an adjacency to form.

There is not an easy way to determine the hello interval from **show ip eigrp neighbors**. You must deduce the likely interval from the hold time.
