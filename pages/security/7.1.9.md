There are certain error conditions that occur on a port which will cause software to shut down that port. Once the port is shut down, or error disabled, no traffic is sent or received across that port. The port LED will turn orange and a **show interfaces** command will show the port status as "err-disabled". There are many different reasons a port may become error disabled:
- Duplex Mismatch
- Bad NIC
- Port channel misconfiguration
- PAgP flap
- BPDU Guard violation
- UDLD condition
- Late-collision detection
- Link-flap detection
- Security Violation
- L2TP guard
- DHCP snooping rate-limit
- Incorrect SFP
- ARP inspection

You can use the command **show errdisable recovery** to see the status of any error disabled ports:
```
SW1# show errdisable recovery
ErrDisable Reason    Timer Status
-----------------    --------------
udld                 Enabled
bpduguard            Enabled
security-violatio    Enabled
channel-misconfig    Enabled
pagp-flap            Enabled
dtp-flap             Enabled
link-flap            Enabled
l2ptguard            Enabled
psecure-violation    Enabled
gbic-invalid         Enabled
dhcp-rate-limit      Enabled
mac-limit            Enabled
unicast-flood        Enabled
arp-inspection       Enabled

Timer interval: 300 seconds

Interfaces that will be enabled at the next timeout:

Interface      Errdisable reason      Time left(sec)
---------    ---------------------    --------------
  Fa2/4                bpduguard          273
```
This is also a nice command to remember as it shows you the error types on which you can use error recovery.

You can manually re-enable the port by doing a **shutdown** foloowed by a **no shutdown**, of course after the problem is corrected. Alternatively, you can configure automatic recovery by specifying the error from which you wish to recover from.
```
SW1(config)# errdisable recovery cause gbic-invalid
SW1(config)# errdisable recovery interval 60
```
The interval specified is in seconds.
