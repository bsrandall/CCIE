Class based marking is the most used method for marking and classification. You can use an access list to match on certain fields directly. Among those you can match directly include:
- source MAC address
- destination MAC address
- IP Precedence
- CoS
- input interface
- IP DSCP
- RTP UDP port range
- QoS Group
- NBAR protocol type
- Host name ad URL (via NBAR)

The two most popular marking fields for QoS are the IP Precedence and IP DSCP fields. They are popular because the IP packet header exists from endpoint to endpoint, unlike Layer 2 fields such as CoS.

Classification and marking should be done as close to the edge of the network as possible. However, these tasks should not be done before the packet reaches a trusted device. Below is a list of the recommended marking values.

MQC stands for the Modular QoS Command line. It is a CLI structure that allows users to create traffic policies and attach these policies to interfaces. A traffic class (class-map) is used to classify and mark packets, while a traffic policy (policy-map) is used to specify how packets in a traffic class should be treated. The service policy (service-policy) references one or more traffic policies and is applied to the interface.

So for classification, and marking, we typically are just dealing with a class-map. The criteria for matching may change depending on the platform. You can see the options of the **match** command under a class-map here:
```
R1(config-cmap)#match ?
  access-group         Access group
  any                  Any packets
  application          Application to match
  cac                  Call Admission Control
  class-map            Class map
  cos                  IEEE 802.1Q/ISL class of service/user priority values
  destination-address  Destination address
  discard-class        Discard behavior identifier
  dscp                 Match DSCP in IPv4 and IPv6 packets
  fr-de                Match on Frame-relay DE bit
  fr-dlci              Match on fr-dlci
  input-interface      Select an input interface to match
  ip                   IP specific values
  metadata             Metadata to match
  mpls                 Multi Protocol Label Switching specific values
  not                  Negate this match result
  packet               Layer 3 Packet length
  precedence           Match Precedence in IPv4 and IPv6 packets
  protocol             Protocol
  qos-group            Qos-group
  security-group       Security group
  service              Service Instance to match
  source-address       Source address
  vlan                 VLANs to match
```
If matching an access list via the **match access-group** command, 
Here are the IP options:
```
R1(config-cmap)#match ip ?
  dscp        Match IP DSCP (DiffServ CodePoints)
  precedence  Match IP precedence
  rtp         Match RTP port nos
```
Notice a few things. First, you can use **match not** to specify all traffic other than the type specified, which is equivalent to a logical NOT. Also note that you can match another class-map if needed. The **match ip rtp** command effectively matches the VoIP payload, as it matches the even UDP ports within the RTP port range.

One other thing to mention. There is a default class, called **class-default** For every class map, all traffic not matching the classification requirements of the class are placed into **class-defeault**.

The class-map also allows you to set multiple match criteria, and use either a logical AND (**match-all**) or a logical OR (**match-any**) on the criteria. Class maps can be nested inside other class maps. Packets are processed through the class-map in a top-down fashion, so the order of the **match** statements can easily affect the decision tree. This need for correct ordering is present on policy-maps as well.

The policy-map is where you would do the actual marking. Note we must indicate which class-map we want to mark with the **class** command (not class-map).
```
R1(config)# policy-map TEST
R1(config-pmap)#class TEST
R1(config-pmap-c)#set ?
  atm-clp        Set ATM CLP bit to 1
  cos            Set IEEE 802.1Q/ISL class of service/user priority
  cos-inner      Set Inner CoS
  discard-class  Discard behavior identifier
  dscp           Set DSCP in IP(v4) and IPv6 packets
  fr-de          Set FR DE bit to 1
  fr-fecn-becn   SET FR FECN-BECN
  ip             Set IP specific values
  mpls           Set MPLS specific values
  precedence     Set precedence in IP(v4) and IPv6 packets
  qos-group      Set QoS Group
  vlan-inner     Set Inner Vlan

R1(config-pmap-c)#set ip ?
  dscp        Set DSCP in IP(v4) and IPv6 packets
  precedence  Set precedence in IP(v4) and IPv6 packets
```

Finally, to actually get the marking done, a service policy needs to be applied to the interface referencing the policy map.
```
R1(config)# interface GigabitEthernet0/1
R1(config-if)# service-policy input TEST
R1(config-if)# exit
```
