External OSPF summarization is configured at the redistribution point between routing domains with the summary-address command. These summaries inherit their attributes from the subnets that make them up. For example, a summary comprised of External Type-1 routes will result in an External Type-1 summary. This means that on R10 in this configuration, the metric-type 1 command is set at the time of redistribution instead of on the summary itself.

External Type-2 OSPF routes, which are the default, do not install the end-to-end metric in the routing table. Instead, only the metric that was reported via the ASBR is installed. The actual routing path is determined by the addition of the reported metric and the metric toward the ASBR, which is called the forward metric.

The OSPF router configuration command **summary-address** is used to manually configure an external route summarization is OSPF.
```
R1(config)# router ospf 1
R1(config-router)# summary address 8.8.8.0 255.255.255.0
R1(config-router)# exit
```

Type 5 AS-External LSAs have AS flodding scope.

As a side note, one thing to remember when redistributing connected routes into OSPF. The router from which you are doing redistribution will show the routes as connected not OSPF External in the routing table.
