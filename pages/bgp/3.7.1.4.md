We saw earlier that IOS ensures that eBGP peers are directly connected by two means:
1. Setting a TTL value of 1 in packets containing BGP messages to external neighbors so that if the packet crosses a router hop the TTL is decremented to 0 and the packet is dropped.
2. Checking the IP address of the configured neighbor to ensure that it belongs to a directly connected subnet.

However there are cases in which running eBGP between unconnected routers is necessary. eBGP multihop changes the default TTL for the specified neighbor.
```
`R1(config)# router bgp 100
R1(config-router)# neighbor 122.17.11.24 remote-as 200
R1(config-router)# neighbor 122.17.11.24 ebgp-multihop 2
```
`
When you use the **neighbor ebgp-multihop** command, the connected check is performed automatically so there is no need to also specify **neighbor disable-connected-check**.

The final TTL as it reaches the peer can be 0 or higher.
