Non-Broadcast Multi-Access Networks are capable of connecting more than two routers but have no broadcast ability. OSPF routers on NBMA networks elect a DR and BDR, and all OSPF packets are unicast. Since they are unicast, the **neighbor** statement must be used to specify neighbors. They do not necessarily need to be placed everywhere. For example, in a DMVPN network, you would just need neighbor statements on the hub router.

The DR in this scenario is responsible for replicating LSA information between neighbors. If R3 send the DR an LSA, then the DR has the responsibility to unicast the R3 LSA to all other routers in the network.
